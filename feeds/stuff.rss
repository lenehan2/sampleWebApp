        <p>The fire scorched through the home on a dead-end street in the early morning hours of December 11, 2018, in Iberia, Missouri, US, a tiny town of several hundred tucked in the Ozarks.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It was about 2am when the neighbours called 911, and when firefighters arrived they found Amy Murray and her son and dogs safe, but discovered Joshua Murray's body lying motionless and charred on his bed.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Luckily for her and her 11-year-old son, Amy Murray told investigators, they had just slipped out of the house to run to McDonald's. They came back to find their home in flames, too late to save her husband, she said. The construction worker, a lifelong Missourian, was just 37.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In the days that followed, condolences poured in for Murray and her son from all across Missouri. But one man close to Murray didn't appear particularly upset, police say: Eugene Claypool, who, an hour up the highway, was looking forward to a new life.</p>

        <p>Claypool, 39, had fallen in love with Murray, with whom he had been having an affair "for some time," the Miller County Sheriff's Office now says. The two met at the Jefferson City Correctional Center, a prison on No More Victims Road just south of the Missouri River. She was a prison nurse there, a 40-year-old with a college education. Claypool was an inmate, doing 25 to life for second-degree murder.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Murray had told Claypool in a recorded prison phone call that she wanted a divorce. But soon enough, Joshua Murray was dead - and to police it all seemed just a little too convenient. In another call after her husband died, police say, Amy Murray told Claypool what his death could mean for them: marriage.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>That seems less likely, however, now that Murray is charged with first-degree murder in her husband's death, facing a life sentence of her own. Investigations by the fire marshal, police and the coroner revealed that a fire didn't kill Joshua Murray. Antifreeze did.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>According to a February 8 probable cause statement by the Miller County Sheriff's Office, arson investigators found that the fire was intentionally set to the bed in the master bedroom, leading investigators to believe that Murray set her husband on fire after he was already dead in effort to cover up the crime. The coroner found that he died of ethylene glycol poisoning, a compound used as an antifreeze. And police found a host of evidence that dismantled Murray's late-night McDonald's alibi, all of which led to her arrest last Friday.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Murray was scheduled to be arraigned on the charges Wednesday but was instead released on a bond with the hearing rescheduled for next month, according to Miller County court records. Murray's attorney could not immediately be reached for comment late Wednesday.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Before investigators discovered the phone calls with Claypool, a half-eaten McDonald's sandwich was the first piece of evidence to cast doubt on Murray's story.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She told investigators that when she returned from her late-night McDonald's run to discover her home was on fire, the smoke was too thick to go inside to try to save her husband. But then why, investigators questioned, was there McDonald's food sitting on the kitchen counter?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Surveillance footage at the McDonald's in Osage Beach, Missouri, revealed that Murray, her son and two dogs did indeed go on a late-night fast-food run - but much earlier, at 11.48pm on December 10, according to the probable cause affidavit. The timing didn't make sense, investigators noted: Cellphone records indicated that Murray was inside the house 30 minutes before neighbours called 911 to report the fire, pinning her inside at about 1.30 a.m.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But in the days after Joshua's death, no one appeared to suspect anything other than a tragic accident.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>His online obituary, picturing a bearded Joshua wearing pink suspenders and a bow tie, said he and Amy had been married since 2003. Mourners were urged to give money to the Josh Murray Memorial Fund. Family, friends, co-workers and neighbours spilled heartfelt words of support for Amy Murray and her son.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Meanwhile, investigators were just beginning to discover Murray's calls with Claypool - the evidence presented as a motive in the probable cause affidavit.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Murray and Claypool seemed to be confronted with two problems: Murray's marriage and Claypool's incarceration. He was up for parole in several years, but there was no guarantee he'd be released - possibly not ever.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>His crime was not random, prosecutors said during his trial. On Christmas Day 2000, Claypool, then 21, broke into a house through a window with a 17-year-old friend, looking for cash, the Springfield News-Leader reported at the time. The man who lived there, 72-year-old Donald Harwick, had won a 1998 Missouri Lottery jackpot, a $US1.7 million prize, and Claypool was looking for what remained of it. He and his friend thought they could get away with $US10,000. Instead, they took $US36 and Harwick's life, leaving a Bible on his chest after fatally stabbing him.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Harwick's family later made clear Claypool's crime would torment them "forever," as his granddaughter said in 2002, according to the <em>Springfield News-Leader.</em></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In the recorded phone calls reviewed by police, Murray talked about getting a lawyer for Claypool to try to fight for his early release. They seemed to be growing impatient: She told Claypool that she was tired of being around her husband and wanted a divorce. She said while he was on a trip to Nebraska that she hoped he never came home.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They changed their tune after Joshua Murray's death: They could finally "have a life," they said, now that Murray's husband was "out of the picture," according to the affidavit.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Murray told him she would start looking for an attorney.A</p>

        <p>The Blues have been stuck in a rugby version of Groundhog Day for what seems like forever. Every year round the start of the southern hemisphere's premer franchise competiiton the chat starts that this is their season, and every time a coconut they come out and fail abysmally.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Little wonder that Blues fans have become conditioned not just to watching the Super Rugby playoffs from in front of their tellys, but to being perpetually let down by their bonehead side.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Question: What do you call a Blues fan with semifinal tickts? Answer: A neutral.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It has been eight years since the franchise last participated in the post-season and 16 since they lifted the silverware. The last decade has been spent almost entirely wallowing in ignominy: for five straight years they have been Kiwi conference wooden-spooners and had just one campaign with a winning record in the last seven.</p>

        <p>That's probably why there's a steely but silent resolve and a notable absence of bold predictions coming out of the Blues camp early in 2019. Even if this year there might just be justifiable grounds for optimism.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>To a man these players who have assembled to kick off their campaign with a home clash against back-to-back champs the Crusaders at Eden Park on Saturday night have adopted the approach that it's time to "shut up and put up".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>All Blacks wing Rieko Ioane made that clear when he told <em>Stuff </em>recently: "It's a cliché now that the Blues are feeling positive. We've just got to be real. We can train as hard as we want, have as good a pre-season as we want, feel as confident as we want, but this has all happened before.</p>

        <p>"We looked the goods in pre-season last year and fell off. The proof will be in the pudding."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Similar messages have come from other Blues who will run out to start Saturday's ideal measuring stick against the standard-setters of Super Rugby for the past two seasons.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We're sick of the talk," says openside flanker Dalton Papalii who springboarded out of a standout provincial campaign with Auckland last year all the way into the All Blacks.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Everyone says this could be the Blues year. We're sick of that. We have to lead with our actions. With other New Zealand teams there's a bit of talk or even no talk, but on the field they lead by their actions. We've got to follow that and go out and do what we do best."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Halfback Jonathan Ruru, who will service a potentially blockbusting backline, concurs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I guess people will be saying this is the year the Blues turn it round.  But we all think it's time for actions, not words," he told <em>Stuff</em>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's all about just embracing that grind for 80 minutes, knowing it's a long season and being able to get that energy right. And just grind. All about actions pretty much."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Time will tell if this resolve translates into results.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But it would not be that giant a leap. For all their lack of victories (the Blues won just four of 16 matches in 2018, and none against Kiwi opposition), the Auckland-based outfit have bshown repeatedly they can compete with their fellow New Zealand sides. Their issue is in closing the deal.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Last year their spiral of despair started when they dropped a winnable fixture at the Highlanders 41-34, then were pipped 27-21 at home by a vastly undermanned Chiefs group and soon after were pipped 21-19 in the return clash against the boys from Hamilton.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Small margins. Massive consequences.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>To the Blues franchise's credit they have grasped the need for change, not just on the field, but in the coahcing setup and the boardroom.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The squad looks promising. They have added a motivated veteran in Ma'a Nonu, and a front-row cornerstone in Karl Tu'inukuafe atop a useful intake, and will rely on younger types such as Dalton Papalii, Blake Gibson, Otere Black, Melani Nanai, Ofa Tu'ungafasi, the Ioane brothers and TJ Faiane to step up. Sonny Bill Williams, Patty Tuipulotu, James Parsons, Michael Collins and Matt Duffie form the experienced core.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Most importantly, Leon MacDonald has come into head a coaching shakeup, with Tana Umaga dropping down to a support role alongside other new faces in Tom Coventry and Daniel Halangahu.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>MacDonald brings Crusaders knowledge and a down-to-earth pragmatism that already looks positive, and Coventry is an adept forwards guru who will enjoy his challenge with an at-times under-performing group.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The new board have indicated that further changes are in the air, both in franchise personnel and attitudes. They are also well aware that Rome wasn't built in a day; that the rejuvenation is a long-term project.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>For all that they will also demand to see improvements this year. That starts Saturday night against a Crusaders side everyone measures themselves against. Time for the actions to unfold.</p>

        <p>Chiefs halfback Brad Weber admits he placed too much emphasis on his All Blacks aspirations last season, and that in-turn it affected his on-field performances.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>So, going into this year's Super Rugby season - which starts for him against the Highlanders in Hamilton on Friday night - he's casting any hopes of a national recall aside, in the hope of getting back to playing a freer brand of rugby that suits him and his team so well.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Despite getting the majority of starts at the Chiefs last year and getting back to some of his best form, after being robbed of a 2017 campaign due to a broken leg in pre-season, it was Weber's team-mate Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi, with youth on his side, who was groomed as the All Blacks' No 3, behind Aaron Smith and TJ Perenara, going into this year's World Cup.</p>

        <p>When Weber - who played one test against Samoa in 2015 - then missed out to Crusaders duo Bryn Hall and Mitchell Drummond in an extended 51-man New Zealand squad in October, he was on the phone to assistant coach Ian Foster to quiz him on his omission, and find out what he could do to stay in the reckoning for this year's global showpiece. </p>

        <p>"It's always going to be motivating, I guess, to aim for that," he said. "But I probably let it creep into my thoughts a bit too much [through last year] and it probably affected me.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It was just always in the back of my mind, where I was at.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"To be honest, this year I'm not really even thinking about it anymore, it's just trying to play way freeer, and with less on my mind I think it will benefit my rugby. And I'm pretty keen to win a championship here with the Chiefs. I love this team. So that's the main motivating factor at this stage."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Weber, who is into his sixth season at the franchise, is contracted to New Zealand Rugby through till 2020. While he does have an out-clause in his deal which could see him leave a year early, he said World Cup non-selection wouldn't influence that, because he has to give notice before that team is selected.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>So for now, it's back to knuckling down for the campaign ahead, with the 1.72m, 75kg livewire getting first crack to start against the Highlanders, on the back of an onerous pre-season which has him "in the best shape of my life".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's been tough, they've been thrashing us. But it's been good," he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The weight doesn't change too much, to be fair, just the fitness is the best it's ever been in terms of testing. I'm pretty happy that the speed's still there, which is obviously one of my points of difference."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Rather than any of the aerobic improvement being a suggestion from higher up, Weber said it was instead purely just a self-made motive.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I find the game's way easier if I'm fitter, especially for a halfback, having to get to every ruck, and especially at the pace that we want to play. I know if I want to play for a decent amount of minutes then I've got to be real fit."</p>

        <p><strong>OPINION:</strong> Cycling New Zealand needs to re-think its Olympic obsession after Hamish Bond's unfathomable omission from the track cycling world championships.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Bond is one of New Zealand's all-time greatest athletes - who else could switch, at the click of a stopwatch, from being a double Olympic Games gold medallist rower to a world-class cyclist?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But, the quintessential Kiwi code-hopper won't get to go to the world track cycling championships in Poland later this month despite beating 2017 world champion Jordan Kerby a fortnight ago. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>How good is Bond? Phenomenal, judging by his nascent results. The 33-year-old set a new national record of 4 minutes 12.436 seconds in the 4000m individual pursuit at the New Zealand champs at Cambridge in early February. His time was among the 10th-fastest in history, at sea level.</p>

        <p>That makes Bond - who only turned to cycling two years ago - faster than the great Gary Anderson, a former Commonwealth Games champion and Olympic Games bronze medallist and 2008 Olympic silver medallist Hayden Roulston.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Cycling NZ say Bond's record time came too late to be considered for the Poland world champs which do not start until February 27. But surely, the UCI (world cycling's governing body) would have been open to a late nomination from a high-profile Olympian, who already has a Commonwealth Games bronze cycling medal on the road.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Bond's non-selection can't have been a financial issue. He was so keen to go he said he'd pay his own way.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The real issue seems to be Cycling NZ's call not to select an individual pursuit rider for the world champs because the discipline is no longer an Olympic event.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Could you imagine New Zealand Rugby saying "we won't send the All Blacks to the World Cup because it's sevens, not fifteens, on the Olympic programme"?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It was easy to understand Bond's frustration when he told <em>Stuff</em> this week that he was "irked" by the decision. "I think I'm now the second fastest pursuit rider this season and I'm not allowed at the world championships. No effort was made to get me there. Why have the world champs if you can't get the best people along to compete?"</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Good point. Remember the Bring Back Buck Shelford All Black campaign? It's time to Get Bondy Back, on his bike.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Cycling NZ's policy highlights an important issue.  What constitutes the pinnacle of a "pinnacle event" - a world championships or an Olympic Games?'</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In this country, it's inevitably the Olympic Games, largely because sport's elite movers and shakers - High Performance Sport New Zealand and the Halberg Awards judges - say so.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It's a moot point whether an Olympic Games cycling programme is better than the world championships, in terms of quality.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But the real issue is, why should athletes - who have proved they are among the best in the world be excluded from a world championships because of a short-sighted call by the UCI (world cycling's government body) and the International Olympic Committee to cull their specialist event.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Track cycling is a great spectator sport and, the individual pursuit is compulsive viewing, as anyone who watched Sarah Ulmer ride to gold at the Athens Olympics would attest. It beggared belief when the blazered brigade put a spoke in it.</p>

        <p>The world individual pursuit title has been won by some of cycling's biggest names, including Olympic Champions Bradley Wiggins and Chris Boardman. New Zealand has a great tradition in the specialty - thanks to the likes of Anderson, Roulston and Ulmer.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>New Zealand has recent skin in the individual pursuit game. Jesse Sergent earned back-to-back world silver medals in 2011 and 2012 and Westley Gough (2012) and Marc Ryan (2014) claimed bronzes.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Doesn't Cycling NZ owe it to their legacy to enter this year's event, especially now Bond has proved he's among the world elite.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There's no guarantee Bond would win gold in 2019, but his national record was quicker than Filippo Ganna's winning time of 4min 13.607sec at last year's worlds. So he must be a chance, surely. Cycling NZ should be moving heaven and earth to have another potential world champion - and get a funding boost for good measure.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It's glib and easy to say "there's always next year - the Tokyo Olympics aren't far away". Bond deserves an opportunity now. As the man himself pointed out this week: "An athlete's life is finite and I guess mine is more finite than some." </p>

        <p>The victims of a notorious car dealer who calls himself the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antony-basturkmen-5038857a/">'Wolf of Church Street'</a> are fuming over the banned trader being able to sell cars on Facebook's marketplace.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Antony Basturkmen, who has legally changed his name to Brent Smith, but still goes by Basturkmen, was the owner of a <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/106661458/furious-car-buyers-ripped-off-by-the-wolf-of-church-st-fight-to-get-money-back">defunct Auckland car dealership called Motor Me, that was taken to the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal at least 18 times.</a></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Motor Me was issued a warning by the Commerce Commission in January last year for misleading consumers, and later in the year was banned from trading by government agency, Trading Standards. Trade Me has also banned Smith from trading on its site.</p>

        <p>Go, along with several other victims, tried to get their money back from Smith but they have had to jump through several hoops, as the he failed to appear at Motor Me tribunal hearings.</p>

        <p>​Smith's No Reserve Cars dealership has also had a number of cases heard at the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal between 2012 and 2015. He appeared for two of the three cases, but lost them all.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Another couple left out of pocket by Motor Me, Olivia Mills and Adam Fursdon from Blenheim, said the company caused them to lose confidence in car dealers. </p>

        <p>Mills said she could not believe he was still being allowed to sell cars despite being banned and having cost numerous people thousands of dollars.</p>

            <h1>THE GOOD: Stuff was all over the Baftas earlier this week, however we wanted to shine a spotlight on Michelle Yeoh on the red carpet in this insanely ethereal Elie Saab creation. It&#39;s got a cape, it&#39;s got a train, it&#39;s got gold, it&#39;s got embroidery, it&#39;s got nearly everything - and yet despite all the accoutrements, this off-shoulder gown doesn&#39;t feel busy at all, merely daintily, delicately dream-like. It&#39;s a masterpiece in couture, and Yeoh looks like a Shakespearean faerie in it, in the best possible way.</h1>

            <h1>THE GOOD: This isn&#39;t going to be for everyone, but it&#39;s a big, bold fashion moment, and we love it. Miley Cyrus is promoting a Valentine&#39;s Day rom com, and so really, this frilly red Valentino is perfect for the occasion. She&#39;s like a really couture version of the dancing red dress flamenco emoji - quite the inspiration. It&#39;s a weird mix of sheer and frou-frou, and kind of looks like maxi dress negligee, yes, but somehow it all works - and wacky whimsy suits Ms Cyrus.</h1>

        <figcaption class="op-vertical-below">
            <h1>THE GOOD: Glenn Close has been showing her strong suit this awards season - her strong suit game, that is. This soft lavender Alexander McQueen three-piece is a particular highlight, with its underused palette, vintage-inspired pussybow and clean lines. The colour really complements the Oscar nominee&#39;s hair and makeup, making for a chic yet totally wearable finish.</h1>

        <figcaption class="op-vertical-below">
            <h1>THE GOOD: Yes, she does look like a bit like a Stablio Boss highlighter pen, but Bollywood star Alia Bhatt is still resplendent in this fluoro Prabal Gurung gown. The bold train and grown-up tailoring of the dress adds plenty of levity, allowing the shocking lime green to do the talking.</h1>

        <figcaption class="op-vertical-below">
            <h1>THE GOOD: Amy Adams brought retro glamour in spades to the Paris premiere of Vice thanks to this Andrew Gn gown. The scene-stealing scarlet hue is pure drama, while the demure high neck and crystal-encrusted brooch add a 40s flavour to the whole thing. The feather-lined sleeves might not be to everyone&#39;s liking (from certain angles it could look like she&#39;s stashing two dusters up her arms), but they do add a sense of interest and theatrics to an otherwise elegant yet simple dress. This is also a refreshing departure from Adams&#39;s usual black and navy floor-sweepers, and we are here for it. Red is definitely (one of) her colours (she&#39;s Amy Adams, she looks bloody great in everything).</h1>

        <figcaption class="op-vertical-below">
            <h1>THE BAD: Kim Kardashian&#39;s chest looks like a piece of Mickey Mouse merch in this vintage Versace dress. The rest of the dress is inoffensive, but the fact is, it simply doesn&#39;t fit across her lovely lady lumps. Hey, we&#39;ve all been there - you stumble across a cute little op shop, and inside find a gem of a 40s tea dress that&#39;s almost perfect, but just pulls and puckers in all the wrong places. But, thing is KK, you&#39;ve just gotta let it go: put that dress down and move on. Do not employ double sided tape and do your darndest to squeeze yourself into it.</h1>

        <figcaption class="op-vertical-below">
            <h1>THE BAD: Two flamingos fighting might make for a great scene in a David Attenborough documentary - however… Dear Marc Jacobs, inspiration for a great dress it doth not. This flash of pink and orange feathers on Rita Ora is bold, sure, but much like us at a bottomless buffet, it could have used a little reining in. Eccentric &#34;boutique&#34; hotel lampshade is not a particular aspirational look (also, can you just imagine the under-chin itch this must create?).</h1>

            <h1>THE BAD: Is Rosamund Pike starring in a modern-day remake of The Sound of Music? If not, then there&#34;s no reason for this leather, lederhosen-style pinafore and broderie anglaise bandeau to exist. The Hermes combination makes the star look like a human knapsack, and yet it&#39;s carrying no winning features. </h1>

But no, this is a look DIRECTLY taken from the SS 19 Fendi runway. They&#39;re expecting us to pay thousands of dollars to look like a 90s maths teacher who likes to cycle to work and is so proud of their early-gen Nokia they keep it strapped to their pelvis at all times. The emperor is in bike shorts, y&#39;all.</h1>

        <p>Despite having him portray a sometimes violent character,<em> Luther </em>screenwriter Neil Cross believes Idris Elba's global appeal is a result of his "essential kindness".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Comparing his 46-year-old star to acting icons like Jimmy Stewart or Steve McQueen, the Wellington-based scribe says no matter what role he is playing Elba's "essential qualities" shine through.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"There's a benevolence and kindness in Idris' characters that people respond to in a most profound way. It's such a lovely thing to see."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Cross says that he and Elba kind of have "joint custody" over the troubled detective John Luther who first appeared on TV screens in 2010.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We both love him and want the best for him," he adds, suggesting that's why the pair keep returning to him, despite both their schedules becoming increasingly complicated. At the time of 2013's third season, they were adamant that would be the last and yet they've gone back to the well for two more stories, the latest of which hits New Zealand screens on February 18.</p>

        <p>Laughing about their "just one more" mentality, Cross says he believes part of the motivation for assuming every season is going to be the last is it "acts as an incentive to throw everything you've got at it".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Then it's gone and it's done, but within weeks I'll start to miss it and ideas start to pop into my head. I think in the same way that I have a dessert belly, I've got a compartmentalised <em>Luther</em> spot in my brain."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>However, one promise that he and Elba have made to each other is that they'll never repeat themselves. Hence this latest season breaks with <em>Luther </em>tradition and has our dogged DCI tracking the perpetrator of a series of seemingly indiscriminate killings over an extended run of four episodes.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I think there's a danger when a show has a familiar format that everybody – the cast, crew, writers and directors – can fall into habits. So I think it's creatively a good exercise to look at the mechanics of the show, take it to pieces and, when considering reassembling it, think how you can make it new. One thing we hadn't done before was a single story over four episodes, so we thought, 'why not?'."</p>

        <p>Cross also believes that, despite appearances,<em> Luther</em> "isn't really a crime show".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's got much more in common with <em>Doctor Who</em> or <em>The X-Files</em> than it does with<em> Inspector Morse</em>, so we always know we have to have a new monster. I'm not usually interested in the psychology and motivation of the bad guys, I'm interested in the motivation and psychology of the people who want to catch them. So, in some ways, <em>Luther</em> is a monster-of-the-week show.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"One of the aspects that I'm most proud of though is that it has never really been like anything else anyway. There are a lot of shows that borrow our clothes, that try to copy us in various ways tonally or structurally, but the only show that we've ever tried to be like is <em>Columbo</em> [the long-running Peter Falk-starring series that first aired in 1968] – we borrowed the format and all sorts of stuff."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Admitting that he watches a great deal of TV ("mostly because I've got no social life"), Cross says he has been taken aback to the degree that streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Lightbox now monopolise his viewing.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It used to be that I ordered an embarrassing number of box-set DVDs and blu-rays and now I just don't do that."</p>

        <p>"I only want to make TV that I want to watch so I just write stuff that I like and whatever might be happening in the market, however technology might be the changing, that's entirely secondary to me professionally."</p>

        <p>"When I first started, everyone thought I was mad – that I'd have to move to London or LA. However now, technology, coupled with global tax incentives mean that the number of productions based in places like LA is diminishing.

        <p>Ben Wallace, Britain's security minister, told BBC on Thursday that she could face prosecution if she returns Britain.</p>

        <p>Begum fled to Syria in 2015. She vanished with two other teenage girls from the Bethnal Green area of east London.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I'm not the same silly little 15-year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago," she said in the interview, adding that she had two other children who died while living in an Islamic State-controlled territory in Syria.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She also said that she didn't regret going to Syria and wasn't fazed when she saw the severed head of one of IS's victims.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Wallace told BBC that everyone who takes part in the conflict in Syria or Iraq must be "prepared to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted for committing terrorist offenses."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He also said that he wouldn't put British officials' lives at risk to "go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state. There are consular services elsewhere in the region and the strong message this government has given for many years is that actions have consequences."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Anthony Loyd, the<em> Times</em> correspondent who tracked Begum down in a refugee camp in northern Syria, cautioned about judging her too quickly. He told the BBC she was a "15-year-old schoolgirl who was groomed and lured to the caliphate, and four years later, with that background, she is an indoctrinated jihadi bride."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He also said that she "had no regrets, she was calm and composed but she was also in a state of shock - she had just come out of a battlefield, nine months pregnant, many of her friends dead through air strikes and all the rest of it - so I wouldn't want to rush to judge her too harshly. We must remember she was a 15-year-old schoolgirl when she left the UK."</p>

"It's a team sport, and that's what we're celebrating today. I will never forget the amazing work that happened here. It transformed our understanding of our planet."</p>

        <p>Opportunity was instrumental in helping determine that Mars once had liquid water and could have been able to support microbial life. NASA said Opportunity hit a "hole in one" when it first landed in a crater and found the mineral hematite.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Nicknamed "blueberries," the hematite spheres typically form in water on Earth, NASA said.</p>

        <p>"Rocks near the Opportunity rover's landing site ... contained pearl-shaped rocks that formed in pre-existing wet sediments, as well as finely layered ripples, crossbeds, and niches where crystals once grew and were later redissolved," NASA said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In addition to the "blueberries," Opportunity also made other key discoveries to support our understanding of water on Mars.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The rover had a "slam-dunk" discovery when it spotted bright mineral veins that likely formed from flowing water underground. It discovered the mineral jarosite, too, which forms in the presence of acidic water, NASA says.</p>

        <p>Opportunity had to traverse the inhospitable, sandy Mars terrain and faced great adversity in the process.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After it first landed, Opportunity struggled to drive out of Eagle Crater, NASA said. The team behind the rover also had to strategically plan how to get out of Endurance Crater, with up to 31-degree slopes, as well as "Purgatory Dune," which took five weeks of planning and driving, NASA said.</p>

        <p>Opportunity and Spirit originally had their mission planned for 90 days, but the duo far exceeded the goal. Spirit was ruled dead in 2011, a year after it got stuck in sand and stopped communicating.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But Opportunity kept roaming, and in doing so, set the record for off-Earth roving distance at 28.06 miles. Spirit traveled a distance of roughly 4.78 miles. China's Yutu 2 on the moon and NASA's Curiosity on Mars could beat Opportunity's record, though.</p>

        <p>A few steps from Baghdad's cultural heart and its famous book market on al-Mutanabi Street lies the Iraqi capital's latest tourist attraction: a war museum glorifying the sacrifices of thousands of mainly Shiite militiamen who died fighting the Islamic State group.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The museum is meant to honour the fallen but it also underscores the Iran-backed militias' growing clout in the country. Their political and military might soared after they helped the government defeat IS - so much so that they are now accused by some of seeking to build a parallel state within Iraq.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Housed inside Baghdad's historic, Ottoman-era al-Qishla building, the museum displays rocket launchers, drones and cannons from the four-year fight with IS. Visitors can browse through the war booty and other memorabilia from the front lines, as well as personal belongings fighters left behind on battlefields across the country.</p>

        <p>The mainly Shiite militias - known collectively as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or "Hashed al-Shaabi" in Arabic - emerged following a call in June 2014 by Iraq's top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, for volunteers to fight against IS.</p>

        <p>At the time, Islamic State militants had overrun the northern city of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest, and much of northern and western Iraq, coming dangerously close to Baghdad and Shiite shrines farther south as Iraq's military and security forces collapsed in the face of the onslaught.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Tens of thousands heeded the cleric's call, enlisting in multiple militia factions, many of which had existed for years and even fought American forces in Iraq. Sanctioned by the Iraqi government, the militias played a key role in the war against IS.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>That made the Iran-backed militiamen an indirect ally to the American forces, who returned to Iraq in 2014 at the invitation of the government to help battle IS. A US.-led coalition provided crucial air support as Iraqi forces regrouped and drove IS out in a costly campaign.</p>

        <p>The militias lost about 7,000 fighters in the war. They included some Christian, Yazidi, and Sunni militias but were dominated by Shiite groups with close ties to Iran. They came out of the war with the image of an almost holy force protecting Iraq's Shiite Muslim majority.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>That kind of popular aura has helped enshrine the militias as a major political and paramilitary player in post-IS Iraq. Militia factions are present in almost every Iraqi province, in many cases deeply embedded in local governance and rivalling state institutions. Posters of dead fighters adorn shop windows in Baghdad and elsewhere.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"There are no words to describe my feelings right now," said al-Oukeily, the teacher, tears in her eyes as she made her way around the museum with her daughter.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Outside, in the al-Qishla garden, families were gathered to enjoy the sun as music played in the background. Inside the building, sombre military music accompanied the exhibits.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In 2018 parliamentary elections - the first after the victory over IS - the militias' coalition won 48 seats, making it the second-largest bloc in Parliament and guaranteeing the militias a say in formal politics. Under the new budget, militiamen are for the first time being paid the same salaries as soldiers.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The mix of arms and political power is a dangerous dynamic for Iraq, a country with a history of bloody sectarian strife. Iraq's Sunni minority and also some in the military and the government fear the Shiite militias will dominate Iraq the way the powerful Revolutionary Guard does in Iran or the militant Hezbollah group in Lebanon.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Shiite militias "are building economic empires, taking control of state reconstruction companies and projects, and developing into economic organisations," said a Western diplomat in Baghdad who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Iraqi politics.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The more than 50 militias in Iraq have up to 140,000 fighters, according to some estimates and the Popular Mobilization Forces itself. They are backed by tanks and weapons, and have their own intelligence agency, operations rooms and court of law.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In an interview with The Associated Press last month, the leader of one of the most powerful of the militias, Qais al-Khazali, said their existence compliments that of the Iraqi military and suggested that disbanding them was not in the cards as long as there's an ongoing military threat to Iraq.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>At the museum, images of the fallen militiamen hang down from the ceiling, printed on light bulbs. Boots, watches and eyeglasses are displayed next to flowers that honour the martyrs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Visitors walk around life-size replicas of militia outposts, complete with real sniper rifles, sandbags and camouflage nets from the field.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They pose for photos next to two mannequins, one depicting a bearded militant in IS black uniform, a knife protruding from his abdomen, lying on the ground. The other, a militiaman towering over the body, has his boot pressed against the militant's head.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"This is the fate of every Daesh traitor in the land of the prophets in the great Iraq," reads the sign next to the exhibit, referring to IS by the group's Arabic acronym.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Museum manager Ali Al Shawky, who was a volunteer doctor with the militias during the war against IS, said the idea behind the museum was to preserve the memory of the fallen and "personify their heroic deeds."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Ministry of Culture, he said, was at first hesitant to give up the landmark al-Qishla building and its gardens on the banks of the Tigris River - long a hub where Baghdad's intellectual and artists gathered - to the museum, but later relented and gave them the top floor.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We wanted to say something to the martyrs with this museum," Al Shawky said. "We will never forget you."</p>

        <p>The New Zealand Breakers have smashed the Illawarra Hawks 130-96, making franchise history with the highest Australian NBL score.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>On Thursday, the first home match played in the capital since 2003 was a dead rubber and meant little for the season but final placings on the table. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But the Breakers finally came out to play in their second last match, cracking 100 points at just three-quarter time. That also was an NBL record in the current format of the game.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Things slowed down in the fourth, but the Breakers still outscored their opponents and passed their previous highest score, 124, well before the final whistle.</p>

        <p>It's been a disappointing season overall for the Breakers, but the win means they will improve on last year's seventh place regardless of the result against the Bullets in Brisbane on Saturday, their last match of the season.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Hawks looked fatigued and were bullied out of the match early on by the home side who led 34-24 at the first quarter.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Breakers season standout Shawn Long led the points and rebounds.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The former NBA player has been the lone performer in the second half of the Breakers season and has proven himself a worthy import. He scored 21 points and 8 rebounds on Thursday and was heads above the rest in Wellington in stature and court dominance. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Breakers dominated the visitors all over the court, including points off turnover (20-10), second-chance points (17-7) and points in the paint (46-26).</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Breakers have had the better of the Hawks this season, winning two of the three encounters. Both sides now have 29 wins against each other and will have to wait until next season to break the tie. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>This season will be the first finals series in the NBL without either the Hawks or the Breakers since 2007.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Hawks' season is now over.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>NZ Breakers 130</strong> (Shawn Long 21, Jarrad Weeks 19, Corey Webster 18), <strong>Illawarra Hawks 96</strong> (Daniel Grida 17, Andre Ogilvy 12). 1Q: 34-24; HT: 63-49; 3Q: 100-70.​</p>

        <p>Te Whanau ā Rangiwhakaahu hapū issued a statement on Thursday afternoon saying it intended to place the rāhui over both the pools and access route over the Rangitapi headland at Matapouri Bay. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"While the rāhui is in place Te Whanau a Rangiwhakaahu hapū will continue to work with key stakeholder groups including community and government agencies to develop an enduring plan to manage and protect the environmental, cultural and spiritual wellbeing of Te Wai o Te Taniwha and protect the wāhi tapu upon the Rangitapu headland," the statement said. </p>

        <p>Wāhi tapu is a place sacred to Māori in the traditional, spiritual, religious, ritual or mythological sense. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Social media reaction to the news has been largely supportive, with many people expressing their sorrow over the decline of the beautiful pools. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I used to catch snapper in the Mermaid Pools in the 90s when I lived at Matapouri and the sea life in this pool was plentiful. Now it's like a sewer with urine and toxic sunscreen destroying its beauty. Let's all respect the rahui in place," one person wrote. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Awesome, used to visit as a kid years ago ... so sad to see what's happening," another wrote. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In its statement, the hapū acknowledged the efforts of other community-led groups who had helped generate an awareness of the "plight of our taonga (treasure)".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We are grateful for the ongoing support offered by our community, community leaders, councillors, iwi and government agencies," it said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Te Whanau ā Rangiwhakaahu Hapū Trust plans to host a public meeting on their marae, with an open invitation to all who have a connection to the Mermaid Pools. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>This was to ensure "that this intrinsic part of our cultural, spiritual and ecological heritage is protected mō tatou, a, mō ngā uri ā muri ake nei – that is, for ourselves and for our children after us".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Te Whanau ā Rangiwhakaahu hapū trust chair, Aperahama Edwards was approached by <em>Stuff</em> for comment. </p>

        <p>Critics emphasised the importance of Stewart's and Marshall's experience in taxonomy - identifying, describing and naming New Zealand's flora and fauna, which underpins everything from identifying biosecurity pests to understanding relationships between different organisms. <a href="https://royalsociety.org.nz/assets/Uploads/Report-National-Taxonomic-Collections-in-New-Zealand-2015.pdf" target="_blank">A Royal Society review in 2015</a> found taxonomists were an endangered species, and expertise took 10-15 years to build up. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Taxonomy expert Professor Trevor Worthy - a Kiwi now working in Australia - said the redundancies marked "one of the most dark days in the history of the Museum of New Zealand".

        <p>A 19-year-old woman has turned herself in to police to face charges for allegedly throwing two chairs off a 45th story balcony along a busy downtown street in Toronto, Canada.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The incident shown in an online video has sparked widespread outrage.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Detective Todd Higo said Marcella Zoia turned herself in. A widely viewed video shot from the apartment balcony shows a woman throwing one of the chairs, which plummets to the street below.</p>

        <p>After receiving tips from the public, police identified her and asked her to turn herself in.</p>

        <p>Zoia made a brief court appearance Wednesday afternoon and was released on $2000 Canadian bail ($NZ 2200) and ordered to live with her mother. She must also not have any contact with the four individuals that were with her at the time.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"She is embarrassed by what happened. She wished it never happened. Of course, she would never wish anyone would be hurt," said Greg Leslie, her lawyer.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Leslie said she understands the public outage. He said he'll have discussions with the prosecution and said it might not go to trial but said he'll see how it develops.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Leslie said she was under peer pressure and they are looking for the others involved.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Zoia left the courthouse smiling with a Starbucks Frappuccino in hand as she entered an Uber.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Constable David Hopkinson said the apartment was being used as a short-term rental. Airbnb spokesman Ben Breit said the company reached out to Toronto police to offer their full support in their investigation "of any individuals involved with this abhorrent act."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We remain outraged by the blatant disregard for community safety on display in the video," Breit said. "We have no evidence at this time to suggest that the accused has ever been an Airbnb user, but we have suspended the account of a guest with a reservation at the building pending further review."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Tyler Walton said she believes she rented the same Airbnb unit, suite 4508, on the same day the chairs were thrown. She said she was told by the host to arrive later because the previous renter left a "big mess."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Walton said she saw the chairs outside the front door of the condo building on the sidewalk. She noted the balcony chairs advertised on the website were not on the balcony when she arrived.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The City of Toronto has examined banning shot term rentals not regularly occupied by the owner, but the potential rules are undergoing review.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I just hope that people take from the example the consequences that will befall this woman. This is irresponsible behaviour that is unacceptable," Toronto Mayor John Tory said. "It was not just a lark gone bad. It was grossly irresponsible behaviour that could have caused serious injury and death."</p>

        <p>Partly-treated wastewater may have leaked into Waikato River near the Pukete Boat Ramp, so people are being asked not to swim in the area.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A broken plug on a pipe-fitting at Pukete treatment plant was the source of the problem, allowing wastewater into a pump building, then a stormwater system which leads to the river.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The "highly unusual" breakage happened late on Wednesday night and was noticed early on Thursday, Hamilton City Council said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"While the spill was largely contained on site, a portion may have entered the river, although this cannot be confirmed at this time," City Waters Manager Maire Porter said in a statement on Thursday evening.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Signs have been put up at the boat ramp, warning people not to swim or let children play in water in the area.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"If people are exposed to the river water in the vicinity of the Pukete Boat Ramp it is recommended they thoroughly wash and dry their hands and any exposed cuts with soap and water afterwards," Porter said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The plug breakage didn't affect operations at the treatment plant.</p>

        <p>A podcast that re-ignited public interest in the disappearance and suspected murder of Sydney woman Lynette Dawson may have "contaminated" evidence. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>That's the claim made by lawyers for Chris Dawson, Lynette's husband, about evidence that would be used to prosecute him for her murder.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Chris Dawson's solicitor Greg Walsh said on Thursday that <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/109109768/chris-dawson-arrested-expected-to-be-charged-with-murder-of-lyn-dawson" target="_blank"><em>The Teacher's Pet</em>, a podcast by The Australian newspaper</a> into the 1982 disappearance and suspected murder of the mother of two, may have jeopardised the case and posed a "very real" risk of contamination of evidence.</p>

        <p>Mr Dawson appeared briefly in Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday. The former Newtown Jets rugby league player <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/anxious-stressed-chris-dawson-to-plead-not-guilty-to-murder-of-wife-lynette-20181206-p50kn7.html" title="">was charged in December</a> with murdering his wife and is expected to enter a plea of not guilty.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Crown was given a four-week extension on Thursday to serve the brief of evidence on Mr Dawson's legal team. The court heard 4500 pages had been served on Mr Dawson's lawyers, but a remaining 100 gigabytes of material relating to the podcast had yet to be delivered.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Senior Crown prosecutor Craig Everson said police were "struggling to get that material in a form that can be digested by Mr Walsh and his client".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Outside court, Mr Walsh said the podcast posed a "risk of contaminating and affecting the reliability of the evidence".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Asked if the case had been jeopardised by the podcast, Mr Walsh said: "Not only the accused's case but the prosecution case.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"As you know, human memory is a reconstructive process – so what a person learns from others, what they read, what they discuss, can all become encoded in their memory. I think it's a matter of common sense that the risk of contamination is a very real one in the context of modern communications as well."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Mr Walsh said lawyers for Mr Dawson had been "provided for the first time with handwritten copies" of diaries belonging to Mrs Dawson's mother, which formed part of The Teacher's Pet podcast.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"That type of evidence is critical in a historical case such as this," Mr Walsh said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Crown will serve its brief of evidence on May 9. Mr Dawson, who lives in Queensland with his third wife, remains on bail after he <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/murder-accused-chris-dawson-granted-bail-with-1-5-million-security-20181217-p50mnr.html" title="">provided a surety of $1.5 million</a> in December.</p>

        <p>The 2300-kilometre long dust cloud, likely made from dust and smoke from Australia's wildfires, headed our way across the Tasman Sea this week thanks to north-westerly winds.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>MetService meteorologist Amy Rossiter said Friday's sunrise might look a little bit redder than usual, as dust lingered high above the country.</p>

        <p>Ko's four birdies were undone by three dropped shots as she carded a one-under 71 at the at the Grange Golf Club, six shots behind leading duo, England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff and Taiwan's Wei-Ling Hsu. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The 21-year-old Kiwi couldn't have asked for a better start to the day, chipping in from the bunker to birdie the first hole.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She added three more on the seventh, ninth and 15 holes, however, bogeys on the third, sixth and 12th left the former world No 1 down in a share of 28th place.</p>

        <p>Ko wasn't the only big name to struggle on Thursday. Current No 1 Ariya Jutanugaran battled in afternoon breezes with two double-bogeys and two bogeys in her four-over 76.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Shadoff made the most of the calm morning weather to rattle off four consecutive birdies on the way to a bogey-free seven-under 65.</p>

        <p>She was joined at the top by Hsu, who mastered the afternoon conditions with eight birdies, including five on the back-nine.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Home favourite Karrie Webb kicked off her bid for a sixth Australian Open title in superb fashion courtesy of a five-under 67.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Webb was in a three-way tie for second alongside Swede Madelene Sagstrom and England's Bronte Law.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Meanwhile, in Perth, Kiwis Ben Campbell and Ryan Fox found their touch early to finish day one of the World Super 6 tournament inside the top 10.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Campbell shot a five-under 67 at the Lake Karrinyup course and could have had the clubhouse lead were it not for a poor finish.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After draining eight birdies, back-to-back bogeys on the 17th and 18th left him two shots off leaders Miguel Tabuena of the Philippines and Norway's Kristoffer Reitan, in fourth place.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Fox was among a group of seven players one shot back after a bogey-free four-under 68.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There were still a number of players yet to finish their rounds, including New Zealand's Gareth Paddison.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Part of the European Tour, the World Super 6 Perth features three rounds of normal stroke play, before the top 24 players battle it out in a series of elimination six-hole shootouts on the final day.</p>

        <p>A teenager who robbed cigarettes from a Hamilton dairy was arrested about 10 minutes later.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Waikato 19-year-old was already on bail when he went into Richmond Park Dairy, Bader, around 5pm on Thursday.</p>

        <p>Information from the community meant police could arrest him nearby, around 10 minutes after the robbery.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Details of what happened in the robbery were still to come, Henwood said, but the man would appear in court on Friday.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He was taken into custody and charged with robbery and breach of bail.</p>

In fact, without blowing our own whistle, you'd say we keep the place in pristine condition."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Over the last four years, the rent has gone up in $5 increments each year, to $650 a week last year.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"In 2019, due to the demand of rentals in Wellington, and to align the price of our flat with the price that other flats are being advertised for, our rent has been increased to $720 per week. Our landlord does what's required of him when we need something fixed, and keeps the surrounding gardens tidy, but he's doing it to make a living.</p>

        <p>"We were so devastated.

        <p>Wellington's average asking rent on Trade Me has hit a record $595 a week, $45 more than rent in Auckland city. <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/110585019/warning-wellington-tenants-will-feel-the-pinch?rm=a">It was up 8.2 per cent on the same time last year.</a></p>

        <p>While most of the properties at that price range on Trade Me in both centres were one-bedroom, the Auckland properties appeared to be finished to a higher standard.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Economist Cameron Bagrie, of Bagrie Economics, said the Wellington market lacked supply and there was increased demand from students coming back.</p>

        <p>​Infometrics economist Brad Olsen agreed – he said there was much less building activity happening in Wellington than in Auckland and disruption to the office market as a result of the 2016 earthquakes had <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/110585019/warning-wellington-tenants-will-feel-the-pinch">stopped conversions that would have generated more apartments</a>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Investor Nick Gentle said it was hard to build in Wellington. "I'm spending $170,000 to add one bedroom to a rental. It's insane. Five years ago, you could buy a three-bedroom house in Rotorua for that."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But property manager Kevin Edmunds, of Quinovic in Thorndon, said it was nothing out of the ordinary. Students were looking for properties, he said, and families who wanted to be in the right school zones for the new school year also shifted in summer.</p>

        <p>Young rugby players need encouragement. It's a vital part of their development. But at what point does that encouragement turn into crippling pressure?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Lolagi Visinia was highly touted among rugby fans and pundits from the age of 13, labelled by many around him as "an All Black in waiting". </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He set records in club football that still stand.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But for one reason or another, Visinia failed to reach the great heights that were promised early on - and it's something he lives with every day.</p>

        <p>He had it all. Size, speed, silky skills and a booming boot. The prototypical outside back, and the stuff talent scouts dream of unearthing.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He dominated at club level, 1st XV and eventually broke onto the provincial scene with Auckland before representing New Zealand at Sevens.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The sky was the limit for the player who once scored more than 100 points in a junior match - 15 tries and 100 per cent off the tee.</p>

        <p>He went on to play 40 games for Auckland and almost as many for the Blues from 2012-2017. No easy feat.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But ultimately, Visinia was made to take his talents to France after failing to cement a regular spot with Auckland or the Blues.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>So what was it that robbed New Zealand rugby of this potential superstar? Why did someone who looked from the outside to have everything end up, like so many, applying his trade offshore.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Good question, and one that I have wrestled with myself," Visinia said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Look I don't have any regrets, I probably didn't quite live up to the hype, that would be fair to say I suppose. But I'm not the first and I won't be the last you could say that about in Auckland, unfortunately.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Look everything happens for a reason and I'm happy with where I am as a person now and that's the most important thing. I'm happy."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Where he is, is playing on the wing for FC Grenoble in France's Top 14 competition.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The former Kelston Boys High product is starting his second season with the club.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Visinia was special, but believed there were plenty of players in Auckland who like him, had the physical tools to succeed but "for many reasons" failed to truly deliver on the field.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The pressures on young players of playing in the fish bowl that is Auckland, particularly young Polynesians, can weigh heavily and often be too much to deal with, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Growing up everyone wants to be an All Black, and some of us are even told that we're going to be. But it can't happen for everyone.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"This experience (playing abroad) has honestly taught me a lot a bout myself and I think I'm a better player for it as well. I would encourage more players to branch out and give it a crack if they find themselves struggling, in Auckland in particular."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Visinia's provincial career was plagued by injury and personal issues that saw him struggle to stay on the field consistently - and eventually forced him to pursue a career in France.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>On the club scene he was unstoppable, drawing a collective roar from the west Auckland faithful every time the ball landed in his hands while playing in the Gallaher Shield competition for Suburbs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The same never quite eventuated at the next level, but Visinia doesn't want to be "one of those players" remembered for what could have been.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I want to finish my career in Auckland, absolutely," he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"A lot of players promise the world and then sort of vanish I suppose. I wouldn't say I have something to prove, but I've definitely got more to give. Right now my focus is obviously here. I'm planning on sticking around a while and making a real go of things in France.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"But eventually it would be a dream to come home and finish my career wth Auckland. It's a team and a city that is obviously very close to my heart."</p>

        <p>A West Auckland woman's battle with cancer inspired her partner to create 3D printed breasts for women who have undergone mastectomies. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Fay Cobbett, from Huapai, had the operation after a breast cancer diagnosis in 2015, but after deciding not to have reconstructive surgery, she struggled to find a comfortable alternative.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Her partner Tim Carr made one for her and, three years on, the couple are set to digitally map the first Kiwi women registered to receive custom-made breast prosthesis, based on their natural shape with <a href="https://www.myreflection.co.nz/">their business myReflection.</a></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Carr set about creating the prothesis after Cobbett found herself "frustrated" with wearing generic silicone bra inserts.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>READ MORE:<br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/106472644/bioprinting-offers-hope-of-new-treatment-paths-for-cancer-patients?rm=a">Bioprinting offers hope of new treatment paths for cancer patients</a><br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/homed/houses/102319559/this-3dprinted-home-could-revolutionise-lowcost-housing?rm=a">This 3D-printed home could revolutionise low-cost housing</a><br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/parenting/pregnancy/92713274/fresh-hope-for-infertile-women-after-live-births-using-3dprinted-ovaries?rm=a">Fresh hope for infertile women after live births using 3D-printed ovaries</a></strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I already had some knowledge about 3D printing," Carr said, "and I wanted to see if I could make something better and more comfortable for her that would mould into her post-mastectomy chest wall and replicate her previous shape."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The  pair spent a year researching and developing the idea, which was fast-tracked in September 2018 when special effects and prop company, Weta Workshop, offered access to its material science knowledge.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Carr then spent a considerable amount of time figuring out how he could make the prothesis affordable.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I didn't see the point of making it an elitist option that only a few could afford, the whole point was to help women so that meant we needed to find a way to get the production cost down so it could be covered by the government breast prothesis service payment subsidy."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>New Zealand citizens who have had a mastectomy are provided with a four-yearly subsidy to cover the costs of prothesis and custom bras.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The prothesis is crafted from a light and flexible inner core which is coated in ISO certified silicone outer.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>As the prothesis is custom fitted to each woman, it is comfortable and breathable, Carr said, and is less prone to being dislodged.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Women who decide to opt for the myReflections breast prothesis would need to be photographically scanned to create a 3D map of their torso, if prior to their mastectomy. If done after their mastectomy the remaining breast would be scanned and mirrored to create a match.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The chest wall is also scanned to create the back of the prosthesis which moulds into the woman's chest and wraps around their torso, sitting in place while contouring to any scar tissue or bumps.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The scan takes hundreds of photographs to create a 3D map from which the prothesis is created.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Cobbett said the prothesis was now a "part of her" and she couldn't feel it being there. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It doesn't move, it doesn't hurt - I look like I did before and the best part is that it can change with me, as I age I can be re-scanned and it can be remade to match my shape so I will still be symmetrical."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Creating the prothesis had been a "very personal process" to the couple Carr said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We are really excited to be able to share this product with other women who are going through or have been through what we have. If we can improve the quality of life of women who have been through the hell of breast cancer and help to restore their self image, then it is all worth it."</p>

        <p>Amazon's Alexa was the world's first mainstream product that really felt like talking to a computer, and having a computer talk back. But with rivals from Google and Apple long since establishing themselves, the next step for Alexa is to become even more person-like, being aware of context and learning from experience.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Alexa can now whisper to you if she thinks you're trying to be quiet, or ask you about a light you left on if it has a hunch you did so unintentionally (at least she can in the US; these two features are yet to roll out locally).</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Rohit Prasad, vice president and head scientist for Amazon Alexa, said that the biggest push in computing right now is making it invisible.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>By contrast Prasad points to smartphones which he says create a high level of "cognitive overload". Users are required to install specific apps, open and navigate them manually whenever they want something.</p>

        <p>The goal with Alexa to give it access to its full library any of "skills" - which are like cloud-based apps - at all times, and let it decide on its own which ones to use and when to achieve an outcome.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"You get the skill you need, without knowing about the skill", says Prasad.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"You just express your request. If you say 'Alexa get me a car', Alexa should be smart enough to know what you really need".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It's always worked this way for some core abilities, for example you can just ask for music and Alexa will play the appropriate track from whatever services you're subscribed to. But in order to access many of the 80,000 skills you need to say "Alexa, tell X to do Y".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The end result is that you still need to remember the name of the skill and an action, just like you need to remember an app. Prasad says it was designed this way to avoid Alexa misinterpreting what you were asking for.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Imagine if you suddenly say 'play songs by Sting', and somebody writes a skill called 'Sting'. And then it serves you [information on] how to treat bee stings. We didn't want this ambiguity to hurt", he says.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But the latest techniques being used by the company allow Alexa to analyse the request, make a shortlist of possible skills being invoked, test which skills are most suitable and then offering an answer almost instantaneously.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's a very hard problem. Because the way these skill builders are building is independent of each other", Prasad says.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Developers are going to be very innovative. They're going to come up with all kinds of skills. And now it's upon us to discover the right skill for the customer. Our long term vision is that you will not have to remember the name of the skill."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The result will be that you can ask any question or make any request in natural language, and Alexa will connect to the appropriate skill automatically. For example if you say "what are the surf conditions at Collaroy Beach", Alexa will read information directly from the Coast Watch skill. The technology is already working for thousands of skills, Prasad says.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>So what happens when Alexa still doesn't know how to help with your request, or you don't know how to ask for what you need? Prasad says you should be able to just keep talking, like you would when clarifying something to a friend, and Alexa will learn.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In fact, this is a key way the system becomes stronger over time. When a user has to ask multiple times to get to what they want, Alexa can analyse those previous attempts to learn more about they way people make requests. So next time you're frustrated by a smart speaker, take comfort in the fact you might be making the experience of other users better in the future.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"And also everybody else's interactions help you", Prasad says, "so it's a symbiotic relationship".</p>

        <p>Firefighters made two calls for backup as they battled a fast-spreading fire northwest of Lake Taupō.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Three helicopters were working on the Mangakino vegetation fire on Thursday, and it grew to cover around two-and-a-half hectares.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Wind and a hilly site meant the Waipapa Road blaze was "racing uphill", Fire and Emergency New Zealand northern communication shift manager Daniel Nicholson said, mid-afternoon.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Firefighters were called around 3.45pm, when the fire was around 100 metres by 30 metres.</p>

        <p>Nine fire engines and three helicopters were at the scene.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Four hours later, the helicopters remained, along with two bulldozers - which help to turn over ash and debris to release the heat - and ground fire crews.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>By that time, the fire covered around two-and-a-half hectares of scrub and old man pine, all on steep terrain, Fire and Emergency New Zealand northern communication shift manager Carren Larking said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"[The fire] is contained between the main road and the power access road," she said.</p>

        <p>Emergency Services were called to the fire in the Kaingaroa township, near Middle Rd, at 1.30pm. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The fire started in a shelter belt which was approximately 18 metres long, he said, but spread through a nearby paddock.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Eight fire crews and two helicopters were called to help and one house was evacuated, but didn't appear to be damaged. </p>

        <p>The fire was contained before it spread to Kaingaroa Forest, which stretches across 2900 square kilometres of the Bay of Plenty region. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It was unclear how much damage the fire had done to vegetation in the town. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It was around 3.15pm when the first fire engines left the scene, Nicholson said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Kaingaroa Forest School got a call around 2pm - in the middle of the first school assembly of the year - and decided to close.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The school was told the nearby KLC Mill had closed because of the fire, principal Marylouise​ Macpherson-Hall said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>About 55 tamariki are on the school roll, and they were either picked up, sent straight home, or delivered to their whānau.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I think the village was in a little bit of standstill mode," she said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It was a bit scary for us, when you think we're in the heart of the forest and anything can happen - and what's happening in Nelson as well."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The village had also just celebrated 30 years of independence from the government-owned Forestry Service, so this came as a blow.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She wanted to thank everyone involved in protecting the village from the fire.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But she still hadn't had the official all clear by 5pm, so wasn't sure whether the school would be open on Friday.</p>

        <p>An Auckland garden festival is in its last year, as one of its directors is stepping down following a terminal cancer diagnosis. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Geoffrey Marshall and his partner John Hayward have been directors of the Heroic Garden Festival for 23 years, but after Marshall was diagnosed with cancer in August 2018, they made the call to end the annual event. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Heroic Garden Festival, which sees people open their gardens to the public, takes place over one weekend every February and raises money for Mercy Hospice through ticket sales. </p>

        <p>Running the festival had been hugely satisfying, he said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's been fantastic to meet gardeners over the years, to go and have a look at the gardens that are around in Auckland, to meet new people, see the range of stuff that's out there.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's also been, at times, hugely frustrating when we've found great gardens but then the people decide that they aren't willing to open for various reasons."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Finding gardens and people willing to show them off was also another reason they decided to end the festival. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Hayward said the festival was about more than just looking at gardens.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Visitors spoke to owners, got inspired by what they said and gained ideas for what they could do with their own gardens, he said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Through the festival, the pair have met people they otherwise would not have crossed paths with, and had gained close friends from the experience. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>For Marshall, organising the festival had increased his confidence, improved his speaking skills and helped him relate to a range of people. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's been personally - tremendously rewarding."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But gardening went beyond just plants, he said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I'm hearing the birds and the insects. I'm seeing things - I'm seeing things around the plants, plus for me I'm interacting with people because all my work is with private clients so it's really good socially as well.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's nature, it's growth, it's the reality, it's outside - it's not just an urban thing, it's much wider than that."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Over the 23 years, nearly 200 different gardens had been opened up to about 300,000 garden visitors, he said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The festival's fundraising record was $120,000 in 2017 with Marshall hoping to make 50 per cent more this weekend. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After the festival, the pair would be resting until Marshall has a bone marrow transplant.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Then, it's going to be some months of recuperation and getting my energy back," he said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>However, Marshall planned to keep working and hoped to go travelling. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"My focus after [the festival] will be working, travel, my partner and good health for as long as I can." </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The pair were "deeply grateful" to the people who had opened their gardens for the festival since it began in 1997 to raise funds for Auckland City Mission's Herne Bay House.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Herne Bay House provided care and respite for people with HIV and AIDS. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Initially, the festival showcased gardens from the LGBT community but expanded to the wider public. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When the Herne Bay House was shut down, the festival began to support Mercy Hospice. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Since it started, the festival has raised $1.2 million for the causes. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The final <a href="http://heroicgardens.org.nz/" target="_blank">Heroic Garden Festival</a> takes place on February 16 and February 17 across central and east Auckland.</p>

        <p>European aviation giant Airbus said it will stop making its superjumbo A380 in 2021 for lack of customers, abandoning the world's biggest passenger jet and one of the aviation industry's most ambitious and most troubled endeavours.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Barely a decade after the 500-plus-seat plane started carrying passengers, Airbus said in a statement that key client Emirates is cutting back its orders for the plane, and as a result, "we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production''.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The decision could hurt up to 3500 jobs and already cost the plane maker €463 million (NZ$764 million) in losses in 2018, Airbus said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The end of the young yet iconic jet is a boon for rival Boeing and an embarrassing blow for Airbus, a European economic powerhouse. A pall of mourning hung in the atmosphere on Thursday at its headquarters in the southern French city of Toulouse.</p>

        <p>It's also sad news for Emirates, which had the A380 as the backbone of its fleet, based out of Dubai, the world's busiest airport for international travel.</p>

        <p>Still, Airbus announced a 29-per cent jump in overall profits last year, and analysts said global demand is high enough for Airbus to weather the loss of its iconic superjumbo.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The plane maker reported net profit of €3.1 billion over last year, up from €2.4b in 2017. In addition to the A380 loss, Airbus reported a charge of €436m on the A400M, used by several European militaries.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Airbus said it forecasts similar profits in 2019, in line with growth in the world economy and air traffic.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Emirates announced on Thursday that it had struck a deal valued at US$21.4b with Airbus to replace some A380s with A350 wide-bodies and smaller A330 planes.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,'' Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the chairman and CEO of Emirates, said in a statement. "For us, the A380 is a wonderful aircraft loved by our customers and our crew. It is a differentiator for Emirates. We have shown how people can truly fly better on the A380.''</p>

        <p>Emirates long has been the largest operator of the A380. Before Thursday's announcement, it had 162 of the jumbo jets on order.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The A380 has been a favourite of Emirates' passengers, especially those in business and first class, which encompassed the entire upper deck of the airplane and was complete with a bar in the back.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Airbus had hoped the A380 would squeeze out Boeing's 747 and revolutionise air travel as more people take to the skies.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Instead, airlines have been cautious about committing to the costly plane, so huge that airports had to build new runways and modify terminals to accommodate it. The double-decker planes started flying in 2008 and seated more than 500 passengers.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The A380 had troubles from the start, including tensions between Airbus' French and German management and protracted production delays and cost overruns. Those prompted a company restructuring that cost thousands of jobs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Industry experts initially expected A380s to long outlast the 747, which is celebrating its 50th birthday this year.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When it started taking on passengers in 2008, the A380 was hailed for its roominess, large windows, high ceilings and quieter engines. Some carriers put in showers, lounges, duty free shops and bars on both decks.​</p>

        <p>The fire risk for many areas in the Canterbury region has hit extreme with a total fire ban issued for Christchurch, the Port Hills and Banks Peninsula on Tuesday.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The ban prohibits any outdoor fires in the open air being lit. The Waimakariri, Selwyn and Hurunui districts remain in a restricted fire season which meant only permitted fires could be lit.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>If the hot weather continues, those areas were also expected to be in a total fire ban by the end of next week, Fire and Emergency New Zealand Christchurch metro area commander Dave Stackhouse earlier said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Over the past 30 days, Christchurch has been sitting at an average temperature of 26.6C, with a high of 31C on Thursday, according to MetService.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In that time the city has only received 21.2 millimetres of rain with at least eight days reaching 30C or higher.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Cheviot's temperature was closely followed by North Canterbury neighbours Waiau at 35.3C and Hanmer Forest at 35C.  </p>

        <p>The fire quickly consumed the family's car, the deck and then the house.</p>

        <p>Catford, Kayarn and Kaleb were left with the clothes on their backs, a trampoline and a swimming pool by the time the fire was out.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Kayarn and Kaleb lost their tank of tropical fish and were left traumatised by the fire.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I'm really sad but I'm just trying to be strong for you," Kaleb told his mum. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The family of three were meant to be spending quality time together on Friday, Catford said, but the fire had turned everything into their third week of hell.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Catford's dad had been <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/north-harbour-news/110063196/person-critically-injured-and-road-closed-after-crash-in-schnapper-rock-auckland" target="_blank">critically injured</a> in a two-car crash in Schnapper Rock in January and remains in hospital. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's been a really rough ride for my family," she said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But Catford said although the family was struggling, the support they had received from the Lynfield community was "amazing".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The boys' schools, Edendale Primary School and Kowhai Intermediate School, had donated a uniform and two weeks worth of lunch orders, while neighbours had dropped off clothes and even a Chromebook computer.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Catford and her sons were staying with a friend in New Windsor and had been "blown away" by their support. Her two flatmates, one of whom was pregnant and due in two weeks, were also staying with friends.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Two Givealittle pages have been set up to help the family rebuild, <a href="https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/house-fire-of-sacha-catford-kaleb-catford" target="_blank">one by Kaleb's rugby coach</a>, Jamie Freeman, and <a href="https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/lynfield-family-loses-everything-in-fire" target="_blank">the other by Ursula Valeli</a>, who was passing by the next day and saw the family sitting on the property with their heads in their hands.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Together, both pages have so far raised more than $5000.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We're extremely grateful and the support we have received has restored our faith in humanity."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Although their house had five working smoke alarms, Catford's advice to other renters was to have contents insurance.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"You never think something like that would happen to you."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Catford said the cause of the fire was believed to be an electrical fault.</p>

        <p>US President Donald Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria has triggered a scramble among international powers and local forces to figure out how to fill the potentially destabilising vacuum the Americans will leave behind.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But as the diplomacy drags on, it is becoming clear there is no readily apparent arrangement that will satisfy the competing concerns and agendas of all the parties involved - and that none seems likely to emerge soon.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Turkey, Russia, the United States' Syrian Kurdish allies and the Syrian government all have a strategic interest in any arrangement for the future of northern Syria, yet most of their demands are diametrically opposed. That they are not all talking to one another only compounds the difficulty of reaching a solution.</p>

        <p>Turkey considers the Kurdish forces to be terrorists and wants to create a Turkish-controlled buffer zone to keep them away from its border. The United States' Kurdish allies, who fear persecution at Turkish hands, want the Turks kept out.</p>

        <p>The Trump administration wants to satisfy both sides, making good on its contradictory promises to protect its Kurdish allies and to give Turkey a stake in the area.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Kurds would prefer a return of Syrian government authority in the area they control. But one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's closest allies is Iran, and the Trump administration object to any plan that allows the Iranians to maintain - much less extend - their influence in Syria.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The various positions are "irreconcilable," said Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East program at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute. "They are massive issues. The US is throwing a lot at this, but they are just irreconcilable."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Pentagon still has not announced a date for the withdrawal, but the questions of how and when it will happen is gaining urgency as the Islamic State's once vast "caliphate" dwindles. The Kurdish led-Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), backed by US airstrikes, have the Isis holdouts pinned down in one last village in the southeastern Syrian desert.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After initially announcing in December the troops would be pulled out right away, Trump subsequently said they would remain until the last pocket of Islamic State territory had been vanquished - and that could come as early as next week, he said on Wednesday. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported on Friday that the US military is eyeing an April deadline for the troops to leave.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>US officials say they are committed to negotiating a handover agreement, but they also stress the troops will pull out regardless.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We are withdrawing. There should be no doubt to that," said a senior US official.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>That raises the prospect of a no-deal withdrawal that could plunge the region into chaos and, potentially, conflict as the competing powers pile in to stake their claims. Turkey is threatening to invade the area if its demands are not met. The Syrian government has deployed troops to the south of the region, and the Islamic State is already trying to regroup in areas from which it has been pushed out. A power vacuum or new conflict could help Isis make a comeback, military officials say.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>To avert such an outcome, intensive diplomacy is underway between the United States and Turkey, aimed primarily at fulfilling Trump's promise to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in their December telephone conversation that the area of northeastern Syria where US troops are currently located is "yours." James Jeffrey, the US envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, has been travelling to Turkey, and Turkish officials have visited Washington for talks there.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The focus of these discussion is on meeting Turkish demands for what both sides are terming a "safe" zone in Syria along the Turkish border. But the talks have revealed only that the United States and Turkey have vastly differing interpretations of what counts as "safe."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The United States wants a safe zone to protect Kurds from the Turkish army and for Turkey it is the exact opposite," said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a military analyst with the Tepev think tank in Ankara. "How can two countries cooperate when their goals are that much opposed."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Washington is meanwhile also exploring the possibility of maintaining overall American control without US troops on the ground, US officials say. Under that scenario, small contingents of British and French troops, who are already operating alongside Americans, would remain in the area together with the Syrian Democratic Forces and perhaps also with private US military contractors and United Nations observers, while the United States provides air cover.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>That is the outcome the Kurds say they would like most. But otherwise, they have stated a clear preference for a return of Syrian government authority over any arrangement that gives Turkey a role.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It is not clear however whether Damascus is prepared to make the kind of concessions the Kurds are seeking to guarantee the autonomy they have secured recently with the support of US troops.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In January, the Kurds asked Russia to mediate between them and the Syrian government. The Kurds have prepared a list of demands, which include allowing them to maintain their control over local government and security forces. A delegation from the Syrian Democratic Council, a coalition including Kurds and local Arabs, visited Damascus to present those demands.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But there has been no response, either from the Syrians or the Russians, said Saleh Muslim, a senior officials with the PYD, the main Kurdish political organization.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The matter is very complicated," he said. "Everybody is waiting to see what steps the other side is going to take. And we are waiting for everybody."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Russia, as Assad's most powerful ally, also favors restoring Syrian government control and has proposed reviving the 1998 Adana agreement between Turkey and Syria under which Damascus would be responsible for keeping militant Kurds away from the Turkish border. The agreement committed Syria to preventing the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and its affiliates from using Syrian territory as a springboard for attacks against Turkey and forced PKK fighters based in Syria to take refuge at their headquarters in northern Iraq's Qandil mountains.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Some of those fighters are now fighting alongside US troops in the PKK-affiliated YPG, which is the main component of the Syrian Democratic Forces.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Turkey, however, is wary of having Syrian government forces return to its border after eight years of war, without a broader settlement to the Syrian war. The conflict, which has seen the Syrian government regain control over large swaths of territory once in opposition hands, has turned Assad and Erdogan into bitter foes because of Turkey's support for the rebels seeking Assad's demise.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"This will not help," said Burhanettin Duran, who heads the SETA think tank in Ankara. Cutting a deal with Assad that neglected an overall solution to the war "will just empower him and make him very happy," he said. "But it won't solve the problem, and the future of Syria will be unstable, uncertain and the way will be open to conflict including the return of Isis."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Turkey also opposes the Kurds' preference for some form of no-fly zone in northern Syria, which they fear would only facilitate the further evolution of the Kurdish autonomous region taking shape under US tutelage.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"If this means a new kind of northern Iraq on our borders, Turkey will not accept that," said Duran, referring to the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq that emerged from the no-fly zone imposed there by the United States in the 1990s.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Turkey's preference remains, he said, for a buffer zone along the border to be controlled by the Turkish military and Turkey-backed Syrian rebels. But that approach does not satisfy the United States' concerns for the safety of its Kurdish allies or Russia's desire to restore Syrian government control.</p>

        <p>A new study finds a way for people to cut their risk of developing a dangerous superbug infection after leaving the hospital</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Think of it as decontaminating yourself. Hospitalised patients who harbour certain superbugs can cut their risk of developing full-blown infections if they swab medicated goo in their nose and use special soap and mouthwash for six months after going home, a study found.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It's a low-tech approach to a big problem: About 5 per cent of patients have MRSA - antibiotic-resistant Staph bacteria - lurking on their skin or in their noses, putting them at high risk of developing an infection while recovering from an illness or an operation. These can affect the skin, heart, brain, lungs, bones and joints, and most of them land people back in the hospital.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The hygiene steps that researchers tested trimmed that risk by nearly one third.</p>

        <p>"It's a very simple solution. You don't have to swallow a medicine, you just have to clean the outside of your body for a little while longer,'' said Dr. Susan Huang of the University of California Irvine School of Medicine. She led the federally funded study, published on Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A lot has been done to curb infections in hospitals and attention is shifting to what happens after patients leave.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Nine US states - California, Washington, Nevada, Minnesota, Illinois, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maine and New Jersey - require that hospitals test the most vulnerable patients, such as those in intensive care, for MRSA. Many other places do it voluntarily.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The study involved more than 2000 patients at hospitals in southern California who were found to carry MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. All were given information on ways to avoid infection, and half also got special products - mouthwash, liquid soap containing an antiseptic and an antibiotic ointment to swab in the nose. They were told to use these Monday through Friday, every other week for six months.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A year later, 6 per cent of those in the deep-clean group had developed a MRSA infection versus 9 per cent of the others. They also had fewer infections from other germs. Doctors estimated that 25 to 30 people would need to be treated to prevent one case.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There were no serious side effects; 44 people had dry or irritated skin, and most continued using the products despite that.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Heather Avizius was one. The 41-year-old nanny has had MRSA infections in the past and entered the study after severe complications of Crohn's disease landed her in St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, California, eight years ago.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I took the regimen very, very seriously'' and has not had MRSA since, she said. "I felt cleaner and safer'' and less worried about spreading germs to her children, she said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Nearly half dropped out of the study early or couldn't be found for follow-up.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Many people may think `I feel fine, I don't really need to do this','' said Dr John Jernigan of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But "the risk doesn't end once you go home''.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Federal grants paid for the products. They would cost US$150 to US$200 for six months otherwise, Huang said. The antiseptic soap was a 4 per cent chlorhexidine solution sold in many drugstores.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Other soaps, even ones labelled antibacterial, "may not have the active ingredients to remove MRSA,'' said Dr. Robert Weinstein, another study leader and an infections specialist at Cook County Health and Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It's worth it for patients to do whatever they can to prevent an MRSA infection, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"You left the hospital, you don't want to go back.''</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p> </p>

        <p>In 2014, Liebensohn and two others, Narayan Shankar and Daniel Rice, founded their company App Social, which created social media applications. One of their apps, CensorGram, helped social media users protect their accounts from bullying, spammers and trolls on Instagram. Users could filter and delete comments or users they didn't want. The app's name was later changed to CensorOut.<a href="https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/862725974911098880" title=""> </a></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Kardashian West liked CensorGram and reached out to App Social to talk about a potential investment. Together they talked on the phone and met in California in July 2014. Liebensohn, Shankar and Rice brought up another one of their apps, which designed "sexy" emojis. They pitched "Kimojis" - a series of animated emojis and GIFs of the Kardashian family. The emojis now include dozens of icons of Kardashian's famous bottom, a stiletto, a Bentley, manicured nails and more.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Kardashian West latched onto the idea and said she would file the "Kimoji" trademark herself to spare App Social the cost, according to the lawsuit. The "Kimoji" trademark includes phone cases, bathing suits, flip flops, T-shirts and other merchandise. The app launched in 2015.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The group decided they would split the profits of "Kimoji," with 60 per cent going to Liebensohn and his colleagues, and 40 per cent to Kardashian West. (Last year, Forbes estimated Kardashian West's net worth at US$350m.)</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The lawsuit says that after she filed the "Kimoji" trademark, Kardashian West said in August 2014 that she was upset that Shankar had circulated screen shots including personal information about her use of CensorOut. Kardashian West used the screenshot as a reason to cancel the partnership, according to the lawsuit.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Liebensohn said that this year, he learned that Kardashian West knew about Shankar's screen shot before she agreed to team up on "Kimoji." He said he believes that Kardashian West held onto the screenshot until after filing the trademark so she could have "Kimoji" for herself.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We decided the only way to get this out in the open is in federal court," Liebensohn said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The lawsuit also accuses Kardashian West of fraud, saying she never intended to share the profits from "Kimoji." Liebensohn is requesting a jury trial.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The purpose of the lawsuit is to obtain Oklahoma justice," said Liebensohn's attorney, Robert J. Hantman, "as Liebensohn received zero money and Kardashian West made a fortune."</p>

        <p>A bid by the NZ Super Fund to part-fund and build light rail in Auckland will be studied by the Government.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency said the Super Fund, and its Canadian partner CDPQ Infra, had presented an alternative to the business case the Government had been working on for 10 months.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In an email to stakeholders, its chief executive Mark Ratcliffe said "further market engagement" had been deferred temporarily. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Government's business case for a state-owned light rail was due before Christmas but is now expected early this year.</p>

        <p>The Super Fund's <a href="https://www.nzsuperfund.co.nz/news-media/nz-super-fund-statement-auckland-light-rail-project">April 2018</a> proposal was confirmed <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/103750310/nz-super-fund-keen-to-build-and-operate-aucklands-light-rail">10 months ago</a> by the Government, and an eight-paragraph statement from Ratcliffe on Thursday does not explain why a closer examination is being ordered now.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Government had been running a procurement process open to everyone, and Ratcliffe noted "this parallel process creates uncertainty for partners and stakeholders".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The Government has asked the Minister of Transport and Treasury to assess the potential for alternative funding, delivery and operating models, for the city centre to Mangere project," he wrote to stakeholders.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>That advice is expected back before the Government next month.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The light rail network is estimated to cost $6 billion, but only a portion of that has been committed by the Government so far.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The 10-year joint council-Government plan, ATAP, sets aside $1.8b in seed funding for the network and leaves open the possibility of private funding.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Government had promised two light rail lines, one from the CBD through Mt Roskill to Mangere and the airport, and the other to Westgate, and possibly Kumeu, in the north-west.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>No mention is made of the north-west line in the latest email, and <em>Stuff</em> understands the Super Fund/Canadian partnership had been unconvinced about its viability.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Public Transport advocates greaterauckland.org.nz said it wasn't clear whether the announcement represented a delay in the project.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's better than nothing at all, even if it takes more time to investigate," said editor Matt Lowrie.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Mayor Phil Goff, who campaigned in favour of light rail, supported the move.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Aucklanders are keen to get on with the construction of light rail to ease the congestion on Auckland's roads and to ensure that growth in transport infrastructure meets Auckland's transport needs," he said in a statement.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"However, before investing hundreds of millions of dollars it is important that the Government is confident that it has chosen the best and the most economic options available for meeting Auckland's rapid transit needs."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Minister of Transport Phil Twyford would not answer written questions from <em>Stuff</em> about when the Government had asked for an assessment of alternative ways of funding the project.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We're taking the time to consider the best way of delivering the project to get Auckland moving," he said in a written statement.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The business case is nearing completion - light rail to the northwest is part of the Auckland light rail project and subject to the procurement process."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>NZTA's statement came a day after the National Party's Paul Goldsmith pointed out that the Government, in a reply to a Parliamentary question, was not going to deliver a 2017 election promise to build light rail within four years.</p>

        <p>Apple bans pornography and real-money gambling apps from its App Store, but an investigation has revealed that the operators of at least two dozen such applications sidestepped the store to put their products in front of iPhone users.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Cupertino iPhone giant, <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/world/110285240/people-still-flock-to-facebook-despite-blunders-and-apologies" target="_blank">stung by recent revelations that Facebook and Google scooted around Apple's rules to gather users' data,</a> is now fighting against hardcore pornographers and online-gambling operators who appeared to have circumvented the rules in a similar fashion, according to a new report.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The unseemly incursions by peddlers of porn and gambling were accomplished via Apple's "Enterprise Certificate" program, which allows businesses to make internal-use-only apps available through Apple's "iOS" operating system, according to the report by TechCrunch.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The developers passed Apple's weak Enterprise Certificate screening process or piggybacked on a legitimate approval, allowing them to sidestep the App Store and (Apple's) traditional safeguards designed to keep iOS family friendly," TechCrunch reported.</p>

        <p>"Without proper oversight, they were able to operate these vice apps that blatantly flaunt Apple's content policies. With just a few lies on the phone and web plus some Googleable public information, sketchy developers can get approved for an Apple Enterprise Certificate."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>​TechCrunch reported that it found thousands of websites offering downloads of apps that had been "sideloaded" into Apple's system via the Enterprise program.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"TechCrunch was able to download and verify 12 pornography and 12 real-money gambling apps over the past week that were abusing Apple's Enterprise Certificate system to offer apps prohibited from the App Store," the site reported on Tuesday.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"These apps either offered streaming or pay-per-view hardcore pornography, or allowed users to deposit, win, and withdraw real money - all of which would be prohibited if the apps were distributed through the App Store."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Apple, according to TechCrunch, refused to say how the problematic apps got into its Enterprise program, and wouldn't disclose whether it plans to change the admission process for the program.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Developers that abuse our enterprise certificates are in violation of the Apple Developer Enterprise Program Agreement and will have their certificates terminated, and if appropriate, they will be removed from our Developer Program completely," the company told the site in a statement.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We are continuously evaluating the cases of misuse and are prepared to take immediate action."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Apple, in response to the reported Enterprise Certificate abuse by Facebook and Google, had temporarily revoked both firms' certificates, which disabled internal iOS apps at the companies.</p>

        <p><strong>20 Dane Coles (Hurricanes)</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Age: 32. Position: Hooker.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Granted, it's been a while since deadly Dane put in a full Super Rugby shift. But hope springs eternal. And you have to think he's been a missing ingredient for the boys from the capital the last couple of seasons as they've ceded top spot to the Crusaders.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Can he get back to that roving, ball-playing, X-factor best of his pomp? It's going to be a challenge, but even Coles at 80 percent of what he was will be a big factor in a Canes pack expected to have its issues in 2019. World Cup repercussions too.</p>

        <p>A top-20 spot for the ultimate 'Glue Guy'. Thoroughly deserved too. Crotty might not be the flashiest type, nor the swiftest; but he makes everybody around him better because he does all the little things that make a backline efficient.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Midfield partnership with Jack Goodhue is quality, great understanding with Richie Mo'unga and a vital leader for the smooth-running Saders. In a tight midfield squeeze for the RWC, looks a must-have.</p>

        <p>Still a world-class strikeforce on the wing and a big part of the Highlanders' game at its best. If the southerners are to contend again they have to get the ball in this bloke's hands as often as possible.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Landers back themselves to make tackles and play territory, then strike when opportunities arise. But they need Naholo running into holes whenever possible. One of many senior ABs in his farewell campaign, and needs a big one to remain in the RWC mix.</p>

        <p>Big, bad and in the form of his life. South African rugby's player of the year for two of the last three years is the driving force for any hope the Stormers have of returning to finals footy.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>An absolute workhorse around the field, Du Toit stuffs the stats in areas such as tackles, carries and lineout takes. Seems to save his best for the green jersey of his country, but the rebuilding Stormers need him at full noise from minute one in 2019.</p>

        <p>The All Blacks skip will be digging deep for his final year in New Zealand. Coming off that delicate back surgery at the end of 2017, he's managed ultra-carefully these days with a watchful eye on keeping petrol in the tank for the test season.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>So though not the influence he once was for the Crusaders, still a class act and big-time performer when it really matters. Delayed entry and load management will limit impact early, but expect him to be firing round the back half of the Super season.</p>

Outstanding all-round No 7, brilliant linkman, defends stoutly, attacks breakdown and thrives in the structured, disciplined style of the back-to-back champs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>With so many world-class players around him, Todd understands his role and the freedom he has to execute it. There's a reason he's been popping back and forth to Japan the last few years. They know too well what a valuable performer he is.</p>

        <p><strong>13 Duane Vermeulen (Bulls)</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Age: 32. Position: Loose forward.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>As tough and rugged as they come. Vermeulen is the go-to go-forward  guy for every team he plays for. He invariably gets that big body over the gain-line and commands huge respect from opposition.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Back in South African rugby for the first time since 2015, he will be the chief influence in a big Bulls pack that will key off his formidable qualities, and needs to stay injury-free for them to sustain their challenge.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>12 Codie Taylor (Crusaders)</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Age: 27. Position: Hooker.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The All Blacks No 2 is right on top of his game and looks well placed to deliver another world-class season for his franchise. Very good at his core roles, but has developed his fitness, workrate and skillset to become a major factor all over the park.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When the Crusaders have their hooker popping passes out wide and crashing over to finish sweeping, multi-phase plays they are tough to beat. And he says he is aiming to lift his standards even higher in 2019. Something to relish.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>11 Michael Hooper (Waratahs)</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Age: 27 Position: Openside flanker.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>As good as it gets in the Aussie game. Tough, tenacious, resilient and highly skilled around the breakdown and running support lines. A constant for a Tahs side that would be lost without his leadership, stellar play and inspirational presence.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Must just keep on keeping on if the Tahs are to stay top of what looks an improved Aussie conference this year. Expect him to do just that.</p>

        <p>Before Al Capone became the most famed American gangster in history, he moved into a two-unit brownstone with his wife and mother in Chicago's Park Manor neighborhood. And now that home could be yours.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The 2,820-square-foot space on South Prairie Avenue is on the market for US$109,900 (NZ$160,930).</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Built in 1905, the six-bedroom building has hardwood floors and hints of a secret tunnel that could have proved handy for the bootlegger.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"There was a tunnel that went to the house from the garage," said property <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/2140426578_zpid/globalrelevanceex_sort/41.772832,-87.600539,41.751929,-87.637274_rect/14_zm/" target="_blank">agent representing the building Ryan Smith</a>. It likely led from a door still in the basement, he told Crain's Chicago Business, but has been filled in if so.</p>

        <p>Capone moved into the home with his family on August 8, 1923, according to a listing by Re/Max, a few years after Capone arrived in Chicago from New York to aid crime boss Johnny Torrio.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Owned by his wife, Mae, and his mother, Theresa, the home later hosted the funeral of Frank Capone, Al Capone's brother, in 1924, the listing claims, before Theresa Capone died in the house nearly 30 years later.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The kitchen on the first floor is probably from the 50s," Smith said. "That could have still been there when his mother lived there. That doesn't appear to have been updated at any time."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Crain's dug up old newspaper references to Capone and the house, citing a 1927 report in the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> claiming "Capone was virtually a prisoner in his mother's home at 7244 Prairie Avenue". </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A 1929 Tribune report reportedly noted the home's "soft lights and velvet rugs".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"On November 26,1947, the ownership was transferred to Mafalda Maritote," Al Capone's sister, the building's listing states. "After Theresa's death, she sold the house on January 15,1953, to a William B. Petty."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The building's most recent owner lost it in foreclosure, according to Crain's.</p>

        <p>Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort intentionally lied to investigators and a federal grand jury in the special counsel's Russia probe, a judge ruled Wednesday (local time).</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson's decision was another loss for Manafort, a once-wealthy political consultant who rose to lead Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and now faces years in prison in two criminal cases brought in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The four-page ruling hurts Manafort's chance of receiving a reduced sentence, though Jackson said she would decide the exact impact during his sentencing next month. It also resolves a dispute that had provided new insight into how Mueller views Manafort's actions as part of the broader probe of Russian election interference and any possible coordination with Trump associates.</p>

        <p>Prosecutors have made clear that they remain deeply interested in Manafort's interactions with a man the FBI says has ties to Russian intelligence. But it's unclear exactly what has drawn their attention and whether it relates to election interference because much of the dispute has played out in secret court hearings and blacked out court filings.</p>

        <p>In her ruling Wednesday, Jackson provided few new details as she found there was sufficient evidence to say Manafort broke the terms of his plea agreement by lying about three of five matters that prosecutors had singled out. The ruling was largely a rejection of Manafort's attorneys' argument that he hadn't intentionally misled investigators but rather forgot some details until his memory was refreshed.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The judge found that Manafort did mislead the FBI, prosecutors and a federal grand jury about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, the co-defendant who the FBI says has ties to Russian intelligence. Prosecutors had accused Manafort of lying about several discussions the two men had including about a possible peace plan to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict in Crimea.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>During a sealed hearing last week, Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said one of the discussions - an August 2, 2016, meeting at the Grand Havana Room club and cigar bar in New York - went to the "larger view of what we think is going on'' and what "we think the motive here is''.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the Special Counsel's Office is investigating,'' Weissmann said, according to a redacted transcript of the hearing. He added: "That meeting and what happened at that meeting is of significance to the special counsel.''</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The meeting occurred while Manafort was still in a high-ranking role in the Trump campaign. Rick Gates, Manafort's longtime deputy and also a Trump campaign aide, attended. And prosecutors say the three men left separately so as not to draw attention to their meeting.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Weissmann said investigators were also interested in several other meetings between Kilimnik and Manafort including when Kilimnik traveled to Washington for Trump's inauguration in January 2017. And Manafort's attorneys accidentally revealed weeks ago that prosecutors believe Manafort shared polling data with Kilimnik during the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>On Wednesday, Jackson found that in addition to his interactions with Kilimnik, there was sufficient evidence that Manafort had lied about a payment to a law firm representing him and about an undisclosed Justice Department investigation.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But she found there wasn't enough evidence to back up two other allegations. The judge said prosecutors failed to show Manafort intentionally lied about Kilimnik's role in witness tampering or about Manafort's contacts with the Trump administration in 2017 and 2018.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Kilimnik, who lives in Russia, was charged alongside Manafort with conspiracy and obstruction of justice. He has yet to appear in a US court to face the charges.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Manafort's sentencing is set for March 13. He faces up to five years in prison on two felony charges stemming from illegal lobbying he performed on behalf of Ukrainian political interests.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Separately, he faces the possibility of a decade in prison in a federal case in Virginia where he was convicted last year of tax and bank fraud crimes. Sentencing in that case was delayed pending Jackson's ruling in the plea-deal dispute.</p>

        <p>Opera singing group Sol3 Mio will play three sold out shows in Auckland, completely in Samoan.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Brothers Pene and Amitai Pati, along with their cousin Moses Mackay, will perform at David Nathan Park in Manurewa on Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 8.30pm.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The trio will sing in Samoan, something they have done since they were children at church.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The three shows are part of Nathan Homestead's Summer Theatre in the Gardens.</p>

        <p>Sol3 Mio, along with guest artists, will perform a new composition, Alofagia: Le Opera, by Poulima Salima.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The composition, directed by Anapela Polata'ivao and choreographed by Tupua Tigafua, is described as a "mesmerising, new Pacific opera".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The group said the performance would weave ancient Polynesian sounds and echoes a time when gods governed the sea, sky, air and fire.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It's a rhythmic composition expressed through song and movement, a statement said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Sol3 Mio emerged as a trio in 2013, with the hope of breaking down the perception that <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/art-and-stage/christchurch-music/66971998/null">opera is "snobby"</a>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The performance will be livestreamed and can be watched <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CreativeCommunitiesAKL">here</a>.</p>

        <p>A 95-year-old Northland man, who lost his pet after he was attacked by a pack of dogs, has found a new canine companion. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Jim Morgan's beloved pet, Sandy, was euthanised after the pair were set upon by six pig dogs in December 2018. Members of the public donated money for Morgan to have Sandy cremated and his ashes sit in a treasure box at his home. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>On Monday, Morgan was <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/northland/110556831/northland-man-95-attacked-by-dogs-again-after-beloved-dog-was-killed">attacked for the third time</a>, by two dogs near his Kaikohe home.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After owning dogs for more than 50 years, he missed having one in his life so The Dog Share Collective, which pairs dogless people with pets, launched a bid to help find him one to spend time with.</p>

        <p><strong>LOOKING FOR A CANINE FRIEND</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Its founder Sandra Walker said: "Given his [Morgan's} loneliness in the daytime and time of life, she [a neighbour] thought a part-time solution would be right up his alley," Walker said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Morgan told Walker he'd like to spend time with a dog, to sit on the couch with, pat and have chats with one or two days a week.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But traumatised by the past three attacks, "there was no way he would walk a dog again".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>On Wednesday, he was finally paired up with "Roxy the Foxy" for the first time. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Roxy will have assisted visits until the relationship develops, and Jim can assess his ability to be with Roxy independently," Walker said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"If it works out, Roxy will be perfect and will likely be the one."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Morgan's neighbour said he enjoyed meeting Roxy and was doing very well after the last attack. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>LOSING SANDY</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In December, Morgan and Sandy were on a walk when six off-leash dogs attacked them. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Morgan was knocked to the ground, injuring his hip, while the dogs crushed and gouged Sandy's hind leg. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Sandy's injuries were too great for him to be saved and he was euthanised. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>At the time, a neighbour told how Morgan "sobbed his heart out" and said he wanted to "die with Sandy". </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Before that attack, <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/northland/79393709/dog-attack-victim-healing-well?rm=m" title="">the pair were both injured</a> after being attacked by an off-leash dog in 2016.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>THIRD DOG ATTACK</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Morgan used to go for walks three times a day along his street but his confidence was shaken after the latest attack. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>His neighbour said the dogs "got their teeth into Jim" leaving him with a bite on the hip and suffering from shock.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Before the third attack, Morgan had taken to walking in the middle of the street to avoid getting too close to any loose dogs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's unbelievable – he should be able to walk on the footpath and feel safe," his neighbour said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"This morning, he told us that he has completely lost confidence." </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Far North District Council spokesman, Darren Edwards, said animal management officers had seized the terrier cross dog that allegedly attacked Morgan.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Many dog owners did not respect the law or council staff, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"They hide dogs after an attack and refuse to co-operate with animal management officers. We have to operate within the law and adhere to a high burden of proof when taking dog owners to court."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Anyone who witnessed the December 16 attack could give information confidentially by calling Edwards on 0800 920 029.</p>

        <p>"There's no reason for dogs to die. Heat exhaustion is a terrible way for animals to go. It's very painful and there's an immense amount of suffering," he said.</p>

        <p>Glassey said that if Interislander staff knew about the dogs, the ship master could have breached the Animal Welfare Act due to their responsibility to ensure all animals were cared for.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But the crew may have been completely unaware of the dogs if they did not bark during the crossing, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"If they [Interislander crew] didn't know about it then the owner did, and the owner has bailed on the restrictions set by the ferry."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>If the dogs were barking, crew could have asked the owner to come down to put them in to the ship's kennels, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It comes down to whether the ship's crew had any knowledge of the animals being in that vehicle."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When animals died, the consequence could be up to five years in prison, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Animal Welfare Act 1999 says every person in charge of a vehicle (or ship) must ensure the animal being transported is properly attended to, provided with reasonably comfortable accommodation, and is supplied with proper food and sufficient water.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A person who failed to do so committed an offence, it says.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The ferry could look at extra monitoring of the vehicle decks, air conditioning and temperature alarms, Glassey said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Interislander general manager Mark Thompson said the company would review its process in the wake of this "terrible" event.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But he pointed out that polices were already in place that require pet owners to notify crew if their pet is being kept in their vehicle. Lennels were also available for hire in a shaded, well-ventilated environment.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We make it very clear that keeping pets fed and watered is the owner's responsibility."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Air conditioning these spaces was not possible in the vehicle decks because they were often open at one end, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Last year, a Greyhound trainer was fined $5000 and ordered to pay $6500 costs after five greyhounds died during a ferry passage due to his negligence.</p>

        <p>The figures reveal 7.5 out of 10 burglaries were residential, with most happening in the early afternoon.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There was a drop of 4706 burglaries, representing a 6.8 per cent decrease.</p>

        <p>"This is pleasing given the invasive nature of the crime and its effect on people's feelings of safety in their own home," Nash said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Meanwhile, recorded robberies dropped by 14 per cent , with 570 fewer than last year.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Nash said this was a result of a "significant effort" by police and investment from Government to provide fog cannons and other prevention advice to at-risk shop owners.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There was a focus on community policing and tackling organised crime, which was a driver of crimes such as burglary and assault, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The addition of extra police over the coming years will further ensure people feel safe in their communities."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>About 1190 new frontline officers have been deployed around the country, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The new figures are incidents that have been reported to police but it understood there are victims who are not reporting crimes and police want to encourage them to come forward.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The last survey in 2014 revealed that three quarters of Kiwis reported no victimisation.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Police service delivery assistant commissioner Jevon McSkimming said overall, trust and confidence in New Zealand police remained high and that allowed victims of sexual crime in particular to trust police to investigate, leading to more reporting.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I think the tenacious attitude to preventing crime flows into this [the data]."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But police always wanted to know more, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Police wanted an accurate representation of the crime that was happening; to prevent crime and understand what is going on, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>This already included committing to a single non-emergency phone number and adding a digital option for reporting.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>On Wednesday police added theft to its online reporting, which already included lost property and wilful damage.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>To date about 5000 people chose to report crime online and he believed they were in addition to those reporting in other ways.</p>

        <p>US Senator Ted Cruz's proposed EL CHAPO Act may be President Donald Trump's solution for funding his southern border wall.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Ensuring Lawful Collection of Hidden Assets to Provide Order (EL CHAPO) Act, first introduced by Cruz in April 2017 and reintroduced Tuesday (local time), would divert billions in drug proceeds from cartel leaders to border security.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>If passed, the out-of-the-box bill would seize any money forfeited in the criminal prosecution of Sinaloa Cartel drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and reserve it for securing the border, including construction of the wall along the US-Mexico border.</p>

        <p>After an 12-week trial, a jury on Tuesday convicted Guzman of leading a drug trafficking enterprise. Guzman, who faces mandatory life in prison, will be sentenced on June 25.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Federal prosecutors also announced that they will seek a forfeiture money judgment for the billions of dollars Guzman reaped from illegal drug-trafficking proceeds. They have not yet released an exact amount.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Under a legal tool called forfeiture, the government can permanently take a person's property if law enforcement suspects it is connected to a crime. In criminal cases, forfeiture occurs after a conviction, ordered by a judge as part of a sentence. In civil forfeiture, even if the rightful owner is not charged with any crime, the person stands to lose the property permanently.</p>

        <p>A leak in Gisborne's main water pipeline has threatened the whole supply, with the local council saying it has just 24 hours of storage left.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Gisborne District Council said the discovery of the leak on Thursday morning meant there was immediate pressure on the city's reservoirs and it made an urgent plea for residents to conserve water.</p>

        <p>Her husband is one of up to 240 workers stood down since a heavy machinery ban came into effect in the Nelson region this week, prohibiting harvesting. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>At least one sawmill remained closed while fire crews continued to dampen hotspots across 2300 hectares of burnt forest and grassland.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But late on Thursday relief was in sight after talks between the forestry sector and disaster management experts on whether the ban would allow for the resumption of any forestry work outside of the fire perimeter.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Civil Defence announced that a process had been agreed to allow exemptions to the ban for contractors and businesses.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Civil Defence Group Controller Roger Ball said he had agreed to allow contractors and some industry groups to use machinery, under strict conditions. Residential users were still discouraged from using machinery.</p>

        <p>"In some areas, harvesting is about to get underway, and there is other work that needs to be done to enable people to do their jobs, and for businesses to operate. So, to allow this work to continue, we've met with industry representatives in forestry, farming, horticulture  and contracting and developed a process where contractors can apply for an exemption from the machinery ban," says Mr Ball.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Forestry companies and contractors will be asked to sign a declaration confirming they would follow established operational protocols on using equipment in extreme fire risk conditions.</p>

        <p>It was the prospect of water restrictions rather than the effects of the fire, that was a more imminent threat to operations, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Since September the factory had cut its water consumption by 30 per cent, to 900 cubic metres a day.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Tasman District Council was now considering restricting the amount the factory could use, which would mean they would have to close down one processing line.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Forestry Minister Shane Jones said the forestry sector was estimated to be losing $2 million a day in lost earnings and production. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Obviously the forest sector are keen to get back on their feet, but having said that, they don't want to be in a position where they are blamed if there is another awful event.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We have to trust and be guided by our fire experts."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Key" forest owners and contractors already had established protocol with the fire service, he said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's whether or not the fire service and disaster management team are convinced that that protocol is strong enough to enable them to get back to work." <br> <br> Jones was calling for advice on whether the forestry sector would now face a more "onerous level" of insurance costs in Nelson and Tasman.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Tasman Pine Forests, the company that manages much of the forest that was damaged by fire, for Japanese owners, Sumitomo, did not respond to requests for comment by the time of publication.</p>

        <p>A serial killer who confessed to more than 90 murders has drawn portraits of 16 of his alleged victims as the FBI attempts to identify the women.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Samuel Little, 78, sparked investigations into cold cases in several US states after he began confessing to the crimes last May. Investigators have confirmed more than 36 of the murders Little has confessed to so far, making him among America's most prolific serial killers.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>However, more than half of his confessions are yet to be confirmed or matched to open cases.</p>

        <p>FBI agents said Little was able to evade justice for several decades by targeting marginalised and vulnerable women involved in prostitution or drugs whose disappearances attracted scant attention.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Little, a former boxer, would stun his victims with a sharp blow before strangling them. The absence of knife or gun wounds led police to mistakenly attribute many deaths to overdoses or accidents. A large number of the murders were committed in the 70s and early 80s, before police began using DNA profiling.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Little was already serving a life sentence for murdering three women in 2014 when he agreed to speak to investigators in another cold case in exchange for a prison transfer.</p>

        <p>He then began confessing to dozens of murders committed between 1970 and 2005. By November 2018, he had admitted 90 killings, but the scale of his crimes rose further when he recalled three more in December.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The FBI said he had a vivid memory for detail when it came to the women's faces and how he had killed them, but was less reliable on the dates of crimes.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Little reportedly told officers that he was a good drawer and promised last year to produce portraits of his victims.</p>

        <p>Vodafone and Vocus hope to whittle back Chorus' ultrafast broadband network monopoly in much of the country after running a demonstration in Parnell – without Chorus' knowledge – of what an "unbundled" Chorus home fibre connection could look like.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The two companies, which are the country's second and third-largest broadband providers, announced last year that they hoped to jointly invest "tens of millions of dollars" installing their own electronics on the ultrafast broadband (UFB) networks operated by Chorus, Enable, Waikato Networks and Northpower.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Vodafone NZ chief executive Jason Paris said unbundling fibre-optic lines would lead to a wider variety of faster fibre-based services but acknowledged the viability of unbundling depended on how much of a discount Chorus and other fibre companies gave internet retailers for not using all of their electronics.</p>

        <p>He expected to get pricing from Chorus "in a couple of months" as the two firms aimed to break into a chunk of a wholesale market that could eventually be worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year.</p>

        <p>Vocus and Vodafone could offer services built on unbundled fibre lines from January next year that they would also wholesale to other internet providers "but clearly it needs to make commercial sense for us", he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Vocus NZ chief executive Mark Callander believed they should be able to rent the stripped back fibre lines for about $23 per connection per month.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Paris said Vodafone expected about a one-third to 50 per cent discount from standard "layer 2" UFB services, which are now priced between about $40 and $65 per connection.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Chorus is expected to make an offer later this year and Paris acknowledged a disagreement over pricing was likely. "It is likely there is going to be a bit of negotiation backwards and forwards."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Callander was more forthright, saying that in the absence of regulation, there was "little to no motivation" for Chorus and other fibre companies to offer the pricing it wanted.</p>

        <p>The technology demonstration involved Vodafone and Vocus showing an unbundled fibre line running at 10 gigabits per second, using their own network electronics, at a home on Balfour Road in Parnell.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Callander said the companies "didn't need to work with Chorus from a technical standpoint" to carry out the trial.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Instead, they bought a "dark fibre" line that Chorus markets as a service to businesses with more complex connectivity needs, and then installed their own electronics at the Chorus' exchange and in the home.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Chorus aren't aware of what we have done. We will of course talk to them about this, but wanted to get it running and working first," Callander said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There was nothing cheeky about the trial, he said. "We have unbundled a fibre connection and are preparing for a commercial launch."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>10Gbps speeds could be useful in future when consumers might be streaming "virtual reality" applications, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Chorus announced last week that it would run its <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/110356885/test-of-10-gigabit-ultrafast-broadband-to-begin-in-march">own trials of a 10Gbps consumer UFB service</a> in Auckland and Wellington next month in partnership with a variety of internet providers.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Paris believed Chorus had accelerated that trial because of Vodafone and Vocus' plans.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But Chorus spokesman Ian Bonnar said it had been planning its 10Gbps trials since the beginning of last year. It issued an invitation to internet providers to take part in June, though that didn't specify a date for the trial to begin.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The former National government originally envisaged that fibre companies including Chorus would be automatically forced to wholesale their raw fibre networks at prices set by regulators from 2020.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But it had a change of heart and decided prices for unbundled fibre should be commercially-negotiated until or unless the Commerce Commission saw a case for regulation.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The policy change, which was supported by the Telecommunications Users Association, was prompted by concerns that smaller internet providers that could not afford to invest in unbundling would otherwise no longer be on a level-playing field with the likes of Spark, Vodafone and Vocus.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Those smaller providers would face the choice of either continuing to buy the more integrated service from existing fibre companies including Chorus – despite that potentially having reduced economies of scale because of unbundling – or wholesaling from Vodafone or Vocus – which would be able to add in their own profit margin on top of Chorus' base product.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Paris indicated he did not see any trade-off. "I don't see the argument that unbundling could lead to a worse outcome for the industry."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But Callander agreed there were advantages and disadvantages to unbundling and that it was a "judgement call" where competition in the market should best take place.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Vodafone and Vocus would serve as a "strongly-motivated wholesaler that would be constantly striving for innovation and would not myopically look at its own retail base", he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He believed a second u-turn by politicians on fibre unbundling was realistic. "Part of our goal is going to be to demonstrate why it is critical."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In addition to allowing for UFB products that might be faster, unbundling could also result in services that could be better customised for activities such as gaming and streaming virtually reality, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Bonnar said "most people seem to think the market structure is working pretty at the moment".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Only the 'big guys' are going to be able to consume unbundling, so if you did come out with a price significantly lower, you risk upsetting the competitive balance in the market. You have got to weigh up a bunch of different factors."</p>

        <p>A Trade Me deal has left the former owner of a custom-made Bedford 1970s icecream truck feeling sour after the buyer cancelled the cheque after getting the truck.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Chris Carrigan sold his 1979 icecream truck two weeks ago, but still has not seen half of the money he is owed.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Lower Hutt man bought the truck from Mr Whippy five years ago to run it as a side business.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The wife and I thought we could earn some money on the side, but unless you're running it six-days-a-week it doesn't make enough," Carrigan said.</p>

        <p>After spending hundreds of dollars to repair it, he decided to sell his truck for $20,000.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Carrigan said he arranged for the buyer to pay $10,000 as a deposit, and then the remainder once he bought the vehicle.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>On the day the buyer was supposed to pick it up a man who claimed to be the buyer's brother showed up instead and spent three hours checking for defects, Carrigan said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Apparently pleased with what he saw, he signed the cheque for the rest of the $10,000 and took the truck.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Carrigan banked the ASB bank cheque the next morning on Monday but by Wednesday he was told it had been cancelled.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The buyer told me there was some faults with the car but did not elaborate," Carrigan said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The buyer has been contacted for comment.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Bank cheques are commonly used for large amounts and are ordered from a bank usually for a specific transaction.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>According to ASB a bank cheque can be cancelled if it is fraudulent, reported lost or stolen or if there is a court order restraining payment.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>​Carrigan said he was surprised when he found out the cheque had been cancelled.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"So he's likely told his bank the cheque was stolen or forged, but I've just been robbed."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A spokeswoman for ASB said Carrigan's story was a timely reminder that that cheques, including bank cheques, can be stopped by a customer at any time up until they have been cashed. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"If you are accepting payment by cheque our advice is to process it immediately."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Bank cheques cannot be stopped via a telephone call. Before a stop is applied the customer has to sign a specific bank cheque form explaining why the stop is needed.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Trade Me confirmed a complaint had been received about the truck sale from the buyer as well but would not disclose the specifics for privacy reasons.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Trade Me policy and compliance manager James Ryan said if a buyer is left in the lurch the seller can file a <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.trademe.co.nz_Help_DisputeReport.aspx-3Fhelp-5Fid-3D897-26cancel-5Furl-3D-252Fhelp-252Ftopic.aspx-253Fhelp-5Fid-253D897-26complaint-5Fsubject-5Fid-3D2-26submit1-3DFile-2Ba-2Bdispute-2Breport&d=DwMFaQ&c=N9aEhCy8U0rJkO1xCZf7rgM9fohfR5qe_N93viZd7O8&r=KX8hyws9Vy_c45SrbB5LafrBv4RDTuJrkd0Y41T0TNY&m=gx8MBLOMGhPKlqIIJ2w_A-Ii3ltoLQFzBclhbCUDZWw&s=fvttT3KHB0eKQAg6Bia6ZuWj8o-X8mXBBvyglsQ6CJQ&e=" title="">dispute report</a> or take a claim to the Disputes Tribunal.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"You'd be a mug to do anything dodgy on Trade Me. We have sophisticated systems in place and you leave deep electronic footprints on our site which can be traced," Ryan said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"If sellers are given a cheque as a form of payment, it's important to be aware that cheques can be dishonoured and aren't quite the same as being handed cash. We recommend that sellers hold onto the item until the money clears."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Carrigan said he had complained to police but had not been given any updates in over a week.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I just want this to be a warning for others that bankers' cheques are not guaranteed."</p>

        <p>Before it was <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/110557002/the-multimillion-dollar-public-land-sales-scheme-tenure-review-will-be-stopped">officially canned on Thursday</a>, it was a rare piece of public policy that had few champions on any part of the political spectrum, despite the fact it had stuck to successive governments like a sloth clinging to a falling tree branch. There was little evidence of enthusiastic support, or even a vague notion of what was meant to be accomplished.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>That was certainly the conclusion of an internal review by Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), released last week, which appears to have sharpened the blade for tenure review's execution. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It was a fall from grace for a policy that had started with promise in the 1990s, when there was multi-partisan consensus between farmers, conservationists, and public access groups that it just might work. You could give farmers more control over managing the land, add to the conservation estate, and improve access to the most scenic parts of the country in one fell swoop.</p>

        <p>That vision, in practice, strayed so far from its origins that by the time it was formally dropped, it would be hard to find a less popular policy, particularly one that had been continued by four successive governments.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Many farmers and conservationists had come to resent tenure review, albeit for different reasons; the minister responsible for LINZ, Eugenie Sage, had once called tenure review "the greatest wave of privatisation since Rogernomics" and repeatedly pointed out it had been "heavily criticised" when she announced its cancellation this week.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But the clearest sign that tenure review was done came in that internal review. There were many criticisms, but the most telling was this: The Crown "does not appear to have a clear strategic objective, other than exiting the arrangements."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It was, in non-bureaucratic terms, sleepwalking.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There is one group, however, that may be sad to see it go.</p>

        <p>During <a href="https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2018/01/half-a-million-hectares-sold/">a lengthy <em>Stuff </em>investigation into the tenure review process</a> published last year, it became clear there was a small pocket of society that, in the cracks between the competing factions, was quietly benefiting from the process. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There are many examples to choose from to illustrate how this worked, but this one is the best.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>One of the earlier leases to go through tenure review was Alphaburn Station, which has a long frontage with Lake Wanaka.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When the lease was split between freehold and public parcels, one pocket of land on the waterfront proved particularly valuable. The former leaseholder, who had become the outright owner, did the logical thing and sold it on the free market to property developers for around $10 million.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The developers tried to build something, but couldn't get the necessary resource consents to meet their vision. A decade later, they sold the bare land to interests associated with Peter Thiel for $13.5m, nearly double its value at the time.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Fifteen years since the land was privatised, it is still empty. Its value has increased 60 per cent in the few years since it was bought by Thiel's company, even though it remains untouched. The annual, untaxed capital gains on the empty land would be enough to make Thiel a millionaire several times over, if he wasn't already a billionaire.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When the tenure review for Alphaburn was put out for public consultation, there was a brief campaign to turn that piece of land into a public reserve. But the law underpinning tenure review said land capable of economic use should be privatised, and so it was. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>If this was the scenario envisaged when tenure review began - society's wealthiest people extracting value from land which, for more than a century, had been tended by farmers on behalf of the public - it was a vision that had not been articulated to the public, who was footing the bill for the process.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In any case, that's what happened. Today, there's very little public land by Lake Wanaka, but there is a thin, dusty trail looping around Thiel's empty treasure box, from which you can stand and imagine the public reserve that could have been.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>While many will read tenure review's obituary with great pleasure, it is unclear how much difference it will make in the long run. As the internal LINZ review noted, it was unlikely any new properties would have entered the process. It had done its dash.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There is no getting back the land that was privatised on our once pristine lake-fronts. Looking at who owns the land along our lake shores - Wakatipu, Wanaka, Hawea, Dunstan - you see mansions, wineries, and luxury golf courses on land once owned and managed on the public's behalf.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It's impossible to ignore the history of this land. Much of it had been taken from Māori through Kemp's Deed, which left Ngāi Tahu and other iwi alienated from land and resources after the Crown refused to uphold its obligations.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The consequence of that was the Crown owned large parts of the high country, which could have been a significant opportunity, particularly in a time where that landscape's value has been increasingly recognised around the world. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There were elements of tenure review that were admirable, in theory.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Farmers had, generally speaking, <a href="https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2018/01/last-of-the-southern-men/">been good stewards of the landscape</a>, leaving it undeveloped. When it became economically unsustainable, it made sense that the system needed to change. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Instead of ensuring sustainable farming could continue for the public benefit, the Crown allowed the value of that land to be appropriated by a select few, at the taxpayer's considerable expense. Land that was owned by no-one, then owned by everyone, is now owned by the lucky few who can afford it. Some parts of the landscape have been all but destroyed. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There have been several wins gained through tenure review, which deserve recognition. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The creation of five conservation parks is significant, and public access to the high country has undoubtedly improved. Despite its flaws, the tenure review at Alphaburn allowed for the creation of the overwhelmingly popular Roys Peak trail overlooking Lake Wanaka. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They are dwarfed, however, by what has been lost. The repercussions of this wave of privatisation, which the public paid for, are ongoing, and will continue long after tenure review is finally dead.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Just behind Alphaburn, a Crown lease called Hillend was largely privatised through tenure review. It was bought by a property developer, who then sold it to Trademe founder Sam Morgan for an eye-watering $25m. The land has since been split up into numerous sections, which are now for sale for around $1m each. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Wyuna Station, once a Crown lease, has a gated subdivision where some of the country's most expensive homes have been built, including a mansion listed for sale by its Norwegian owner for $33m. On the same road, the former Crown lease at Closeburn station contains houses that sell for between $10m and $25m.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>This doesn't even begin to confront the significant biodiversity losses in the Mackenzie Basin, or the land farmers had successfully tended for generations being handed to an under-resourced Department of Conservation to look after. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Again, maybe that was the intent – providing lucrative real estate for wealthy bolthole seekers, at the expense of others. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>If it was, it's hard to envisage how tenure review has benefited the public at large, who paid for the process to happen, but the overwhelming majority of whom have had no opportunity to realise the benefit. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The future of the high country has yet to be revealed. The Crown, it seems, will continue to own and manage more than one million hectares for the forseeable future, which it does on the public's behalf.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It's the same challenge the Crown faced two decades ago. Perhaps this time the vision will meet reality.</p>

        <p>TVNZ's improved financial performance has provided it with a platform to make "bigger bets" in its future, chief executive Kevin Kenrick has told MPs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He said it needed to improve its position in online news, but said it would be inappropriate to comment <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/109980626/nine-boss-hugh-marks-rules-nothing-out-says-stuff-could-float" target="_blank">on whether that might involve buying Stuff.</a></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Chairwoman Therese Walsh said TVNZ wanted to "partake in any discussions" about how to make the media more efficient "whether that be public media or private media", after initially being questioned by a select committee about the prosect of a merger with RNZ.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The comments appear unlikely to dampen speculation that the state-owned broadcaster might be a left-of-field candidate to pick up some or all of Stuff Ltd, which is being put up for sale by its Australian owner, Nine.</p>

        <p>TVNZ last week <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/110367152/stuff-faces-possible-breakup-as-nzme-readies-its-wall" title="">declined to say whether it might seek an "information memorandum"</a> which is being prepared by Nine for prospective buyers of Stuff.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Last year was the first time in five years that TVNZ had managed to increase its annual revenues, year on year, Walsh said, describing it as a "great year for TVNZ in the context of a very competitive, fragmented media industry".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Walsh said TVNZ's improved performance had "allowed it a little bit of headroom to invest in the future".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Kenrick said that as well as having more "fiscal headroom" TVNZ now also had "more confidence about our ability to have a more stable business and therefore to place some bigger bets".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We obviously continue to focus first and foremost on TV performance because that is the big engine that drives our business ... but we have also been investing in future potential areas for the business.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We have been doing a lot of work around what the future of news might look like ... and also what other digital platforms we might participate in."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Kenrick signalled TVNZ held a strong interest in the overall health of the media sector. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The theme we are focused on right now is looking at what is going to create the most robust outcomes for the industry particularly around local content.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Yes, we need to get our own house in order but we operate as part of the broader media sector and the health and wellbeing of that sector has a bearing on us as well."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Speaking after the select committee meeting, Kenrick said online local news reporting "had to be key" to its future plans.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We have translated a leadership position around entertainment TV content into the digital world.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We have got the market-leading TV news. But we haven't translated that into a leadership position in digital news and so we need to find some solutions around that – news is so critical to us that we have to accept that what we have done so far has not been enough."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>TVNZ would look at anything that could assist with that and "weigh it up accordingly", he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But he said he did not think it would be appropriate to comment on whether an acquisition of Stuff was an option. </p>

        <p>There has been quite the buzz around the team in Auckland, something that has been a theme this season, where they are on track to make the playoffs for just the second time since 2012 and have, at times, played some impressive football.</p>

        <p>Whatever you make of the club's success this summer, there is far too much uncertainty.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>What happens if coach Mark Rudan leaves ahead of time, <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/a-league/110521295/wellington-phoenix-coach-mark-rudan-refuses-to-commit-to-second-season" target="_blank">a prospect that is looking increasingly likely</a>? It took forever for the club to end up with him at the end of last season, so where do they go once he's no longer an option? He has clearly had a massive impact, but will it last if he ups sticks so soon?</p>

At the very least, any plans for Rudan to be leading negotiations with off-contract players should be canned.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Speaking of off-contract players, what if star striker Roy Krishna goes? <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/a-league/110496436/rival-aleague-clubs-keen-on-star-wellington-phoenix-striker-roy-krishna" target="_blank">His agent has said there is interest in his services from around the A-League</a>, and it was only 12 months ago that he was denied  a dream move to Major League Soccer. This is likely to be his final big contract and he will want it to be a good one.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Then what if some of the other 17 off-contract players go? The likes of Dylan Fox and Ryan Lowry, on the fringes of the squad, wouldn't leave big holes to fill, but the likes of Mandi and David Williams would take some work to replace. It's worth noting here that Steven Taylor would not engage with questions about his future on Thursday, even though the club has an option to extend his contract and it should be a fait accompli.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>What if Huawei decides not to renew its shirt sponsorship, whether for political reasons or business ones? <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/a-league/110463868/wellington-phoenix-unsure-whether-huawei-sponsorship-will-be-renewed" target="_blank">General manager David Dome said last week that he'd hate to think where the club would be without it and he doesn't know if it will continue</a>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The club might survive one or two of those blows, but all four of them are distinctly possible as things stand, and that should worry fans, especially the Yellow Fever faithful.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>None of this is new to them, of course.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It's just a shame it's all coming to a head at a time when the club should be celebrating and looking forward to the battle to secure a home playoff.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But as one Yellow Fever forums poster put it on Friday: "I've almost missed the doom and gloom around here. Almost".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Perhaps it's just meant to be this way.</p>

        <p>Mars One Ventures, the publicly traded Swiss arm of the company, <a href="https://bs.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-375.837.130#" target="_blank">began bankruptcy proceedings in Switzerland on January 15</a>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The bankruptcy court records <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/ap65os/mars_one_goes_bankrupt/" target="_blank">were noticed by a Reddit user</a>, and <a href="https://www.mars-one.com/news/press-releases/mars-one-ventures-ag-in-administration" target="_blank">confirmed by the company</a> on Monday.</p>

        <p>The company said it would be able to begin a colony on Mars by 2025 with a $US6 billion budget, far cheaper than any other state agency or independent corporation estimated (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/mars-one-ceo-on-mission-feasibility-2015-3" target="_blank">NASA estimates that a similar plan would cost between US$80 billion and US$100b</a>).</p>

        <p>Nonetheless, Lansdorp opened up applications for prospective astronauts. More than 200,000 people applied in 2013, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/mars-one-trip-wont-work-2015-2" title="">Lansdorp said</a> (<a href="https://medium.com/matter/mars-one-insider-quits-dangerously-flawed-project-2dfef95217d3" target="_blank">the number has been disputed</a>). The company originally planned to select 100 people for their theoretical mission to space.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But <a href="https://medium.com/matter/all-dressed-up-for-mars-and-nowhere-to-go-7e76df527ca0" target="_blank">months later</a>, many of the finalists Mars One selected said they suspected it was all a hoax.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Lansdorp also never fully explained how he would raise the funds for the project. While at times <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/12/693945694/mars-one-fizzles-into-bankruptcy-after-promising-a-new-life-in-space" target="_blank">he proposed it could be sustained by creating a reality show about the experience on Mars</a>, it's unlikely that would be enough.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Commenters on Reddit likened the fiasco to the <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/92043098/fyre-festival-inside-the-nightmare-17k-festival-that-went-to-pieces" target="_blank">Fyre Festival</a> debacle.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Wait, the next Fyre Festival isn't going to be on Mars?"<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/ap65os/mars_one_goes_bankrupt/eg90j4y/" target="_blank">one commenter wrote on the news of the bankruptcy</a>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In addition to its corporate division, Mars One also has a non-profit arm, the Mars One Foundation. The Foundation is still solvent, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/to-almost-no-ones-surprise-mars-one-is-done/" target="_blank">according to a Mars One press release on Tuesday</a>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In the press release, Mars One announced that "discussions have been held with a new investment company" to revive Mars One Ventures by paying its debts.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Mars One Ventures will establish a marketing machine, creating continuous content about these activities, evaluated from all angles, including technological, psychological, economical, and ethical aspects," the statement reads.</p>

        <p>A Manawatū mother who was desperately ill with the same sort of infection that killed a new mum at Palmerston North Hospital is urging women not to hesitate to get help if they feel feverish in the days after childbirth.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>MidCentral Health has confirmed there were three cases of Strep A postnatal infection in recent weeks and is investigating the care of the woman who died.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Te Papaioea Birthing Centre said the two women who had their babies between late December and early January at the Ruahine St primary birthing facility went home well and later developed Strep A infections five and 14 days, respectively, after birth.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They and their babies were now well.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/110508300/new-mum-dies-of-rare-strep-infection-in-palmerston-north-hospital" title=""></a>A spokeswoman for the birthing centre said their thoughts and condolences were with the family of the woman who died.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She said the midwives who delivered the three babies all tested negative for the bug.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Manawatū mother, who spoke anonymously to <em>Stuff,</em> said her experience with the bacterial infection was three years ago.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She had just had her second baby, at home, and her labour had gone so well the baby arrived before the midwife did.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But within the next 24 hours she began to feel feverish and unwell, with pain in her lower abdomen.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She called her midwife, who visited, and within 48 hours of having the baby she was admitted to hospital with a massive infection, "but I probably needed to be there earlier".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The woman was treated with intravenous antibiotics and stayed in hospital for nearly a week.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I had heard that infection can be common after birth, but I did not realise how deadly it can be."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She said she did not want women to be scared or worry unnecessarily, but they needed to be aware how urgently an infection needed to be treated.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The birthing centre spokeswoman said pregnant women often carried Group B Strep in the birth canal and the bacteria was often picked up in urine tests or vaginal swabs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Those women were given antibiotics in labour because the bug could be a risk to babies.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Group A Strep was different, as it was carried on the skin or in the throat rather than in the birth canal.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The symptoms of infection after birth could come on rapidly, with fever or generally feeling unwell, similar to symptoms of a breast infection.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"If a woman is experiencing flu-like symptoms after having a baby or thinks she might be getting a breast infection it's important to seek treatment as soon as possible."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Group A Strep spread from person to person through coughing and skin contact, and could survive on unclean surfaces.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Good hand hygiene was the best prevention and it was a good idea for people with a sore throat or skin infection to stay away from new mums and their babies.</p>

        <p>Hong Kong Airlines is quitting New Zealand just over two years after its first flight touched down in Auckland.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The full-service airline launched services between Hong Kong and Auckland in November 2016.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It serviced the route with a 283 seat Airbus A330-200, flying seven times a week during the peak season and five times a week off peak.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The airline said in a written statement it would discontinue services between Hong Kong and Auckland from 22 May 2019.</p>

        <p>"Hong Kong Airlines is making adjustments to its business strategy to better respond to market forces and operational conditions."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Auckland Airport aeronautical commercial general manager Scott Tasker said it was disappointed by the airline's decision to quit the market, as it removed a travel option for passengers flying to and from Auckland and Hong Kong.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>However, the route was still well serviced with Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific flying up to three times a day, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Hong Kong Airlines' decision to leave New Zealand comes just a months after low cost carrier <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/108457940/airasia-drops-auckland-route" target="_blank">AirAsia decided to axe its Kuala Lumpur to Auckland service</a> in February.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The airline's website is not selling direct fares from Auckland to Hong Kong beyond May.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Instead it is offering Auckland to Hong Kong flights operated by Virgin Airlines via Australian airports.</p>

        <p>Haidee Tiffen has stepped down as White Ferns coach for the three-match Rose Bowl series against Australia.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Tiffen has requested a leave of absence in the wake of a New Zealand Cricket (NZC) World T20 campaign review, which recommended all coaching and support staff roles be advertised at the completion of their contract periods.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The series against Australia gets under way in Perth on February 22 and high performance coach Bob Carter has been appointed as interim coach.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Tiffen, 39, said given the nature of the recent review it was in the team's best interests that she did not join the team when they depart on Monday.</p>

        <p>"I just want to do what's best for the team," she said in a NZC statement.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The review was fairly confronting and challenging and I can't really imagine being in the right frame of mind to help this side during the upcoming Rose Bowl series.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I love the players; I love the team and I love the job – but for everyone's sake I think this is the best course of action at the moment."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The White Ferns failed to advance from pool play at last year's World Twenty20 in the Caribbean amid <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/107043016/nz-cricket-knew-of-tension-between-suzie-bates-haidee-tiffen-but-back-coach-to-do-the-job">reports about disharmony among senior players and questions over Tiffen's leadership</a>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Alarm bells sounded pre-tournament when New Zealand's star player Suzie Bates announced she was stepping aside as captain and handing over to Amy Satterthwaite.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Bates later acknowledged differences of opinion with Tiffen on selection and tension between the pair on the tour of England.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Head of high performance Bryan Stronach said NZC accepted Tiffen's request and would provide support for her during what was clearly a stressful time.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The high performance environment is an extremely challenging one and the most important thing we can do right now is make sure we support Haidee," he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We totally respect her position and will work through this with her."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Tiffen, who played 117 ODIs and two test matches for the White Ferns, has been coach of the national women's side since 2015.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She was re-apppointed for two more years in 2017 despite overseeing a disappointing 50-over World Cup campaign, which also saw an independent review commissioned into the side's performance.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Stronach said Tiffen would remain on her contract until its expiry date of July 31, and had been encouraged to reapply for the position.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>​The roles of assistant coaches Matthew Bell and Jacob Oram will also be advertised.</p>

        <p><strong>What Men Want (R16, 117 mins) Directed by Adam Shankman </strong>★½<br> <br> Back in 2000, there was a romantic-comedy (and I'm using both words in their loosest possible interpretation) called <em>What Women Want</em>, starring Mel Gibson running the full gamut of his comedic personae, from smug to rancid and back again, over the course of two fairly interminable hours. <br> <br> The premise of the film was that Gibson had magically acquired the power to hear what women were thinking. And that he would use his new found gifts, firstly to advance his advertising agency career, and then to acquire some of them "learnings" Steve Hansen loves so much. In Gibson's case, this boiled down to the importance of telling the truth and treating people with respect. <br> <br> Given the trajectory of Gibson's career and personal life in the next decade, perhaps he could have taken the film's script a little closer to heart.<br> <br> A gender swapped remake of <em>What Women Want</em>, on the face of it, is a pretty cute idea. The world has thankfully moved on, a little, from presenting oblivious narcissism as the foundational instincts of a comedy lead. And so this <em>What Men Want</em> arrives seemingly with the potential to be a smart and maybe darkly funny re-evaluation of all the attitudes and beliefs the original film never quite got around to really questioning.<br> <br> Which <em>What Men Want </em>immediately squanders by being pretty much the laziest, most non-threatening and predictable iteration of its premise that it could possibly be.</p>

        <p>At the centre of every scene of the film is Taraji P. Henson <em>(Hidden Figures</em>), giving it everything she has to hold the project together. Henson's ambitious sports agent (cue celebrity cameos) has been passed over for promotion. She opines that is only because the all-male board of directors are uncomfortable with a woman's success. Her colleagues tell her it is because she doesn't relate well to men and comes across as a bully. <br> <br> The script, unforgiveably, then tries to entertain both points of view, before finally coming down on Henson's side in a drop-the-mic finale that is as unearned as it is predictable. <br> <br> Around Henson, Aldis Hodge (<em>Hidden Figures</em>) is fine as potential boyfriend Will, while Tracy Morgan (<em>30 Rock</em>) has a strong game as the overbearing Dad of a young athlete at the centre of a bidding war.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Journeyman director Adam Shankman (<em>Hairspray</em>) directs like he has a bus to catch, with every scene made up of the minimum number of standard frames and the performers seemingly never given the time to explore what any scene or line might actually be able to deliver. The out-takes and blooper reel, all starring Erykah Badu as a faux-psychic, delivered the only laugh I got out of the entire film.<br> <br> <em>What Men Want</em> is an idea wasted and an opportunity rejected. </p>

        <p>The game was deadlocked at 5-5 until the top of the seventh inning when Japan leftfielder Yusake Morita slammed a three-run home run.</p>

        <p>North Harbour scored a 2-0 win over host team Canterbury, despite being outbatted five hits to two. Junior Black Sox infielder Kaleb Rona drove in Harbour's first run while Black Sox B team members Callum Bishop and Josh Harbrow had Canterbury's hits.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Wellington edged Counties Manukau-Waikato 2-1 in an eight innings tiebreaker and beat Southern Pride, 3-0, after two hits from Black Sox outfielder Reilly Makea and another good pitching display from Sam Marley, who took five strikeouts for five hits and two walks.</p>

        <p>Brear and fellow past and present White Sox teammates Ancelle van Molendorff, Kyla Bromhead, Katrina Nukunuku, Zoe Tolhopf had hits for Auckland, as did Meg Glading and Bohemian Quinn - two former Canterbury players back on home soil. </p>

        <p>Hutt Valley rebounded to thump Canterbury 7-0 in five innings with Andrews continuing her good batting form. The experienced third baseman had two hits from three at-bats, as did White Sox teammate Danica Ferriso.

        <p>In the space of two ODIs, Matt Henry has gone from on the cusp to a certainty in New Zealand's Cricket World Cup squad.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Canterbury seamer backed up his stellar 4-35 in the final ODI against India in Wellington with another impressive showing against Bangladesh in Napier on Wednesday, taking 2-48.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Henry and senior new ball partner Trent Boult knocked the top off the Bangladesh top order as New Zealand went on to record a comfortable eight wicket win.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Bowling six overs on the trot to start the match, Henry struck early, producing a ripper to knock over opener Liton Das. He then covered plenty of ground to catch Soumya Sarkar off his own bowling, who had looked menacing, racing to 30 from 22 balls.</p>

        <p>Henry's place in the 15-man World Cup squad, which begins against Sri Lanka at Cardiff on June 1, appeared in jeopardy before his heroics in Wellington. He was expensive in the three ODIs against Sri Lanka in January and missed selection for the opening three ODI losses to India.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Doug Bracewell loomed as a serious challenger for his spot after some solid outings against India and shining in the T20 victory over Sri Lanka.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>With figures of 6-83 from 19 overs in his past two ODIs against India and Bangladesh, Henry has guaranteed his place in the Cup squad, which will be named in April. He has also gone a long way to cementing his berth in New Zealand's first-choice ODI XI, alongside frontline quicks Boult and Lockie Ferguson.</p>

        <p>It would only be natural if Henry worried whether his World Cup hopes were slipping away early in the home summer, but he has allayed those fears.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He wasn't used in the test series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates or against Sri Lanka at home, so was always going to take time to reach his best with the ball.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I've felt good all summer, to be honest. It's just been good to get a bit of an opportunity and the ball is coming out nice," Henry said.</p>

        <p>"It's always nice when the bowling group comes together and we put performances together."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Henry was a late call-up to the 2015 World Cup, being summoned as an injury replacement for Adam Milne. He was chucked right into the playing XI against South Africa in New Zealand's thrilling semifinal win at Eden Park and also featured in the final loss to Australia at the MCG, where he removed David Warner and Michael Clarke.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Attending a second World Cup would be huge for Henry, but for now, he was only concerned about doing well against Bangladesh.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I think it's a goal for everyone. It's a pretty special thing to play in a World Cup.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Every time you're putting on a black jersey you're just going out there to do your best for the team and doing what you can to achieve what you can to get a result."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Henry and the Black Caps were greeted by balmy Christchurch weather, which ticked over 30 degrees, as they touched down in the Garden City on Thursday. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They will look to close out the Bangladesh ODI series on Saturday at Hagley Oval with a match still to play in Dunedin on Wednesday.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>That would go a small way to atoning for their 4-1 ODI thumping by India and show they are tracking in the right direction, albeit against a Bangladesh team, who are yet to win an ODI in New Zealand. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Hagley Oval has been a happy hunting ground for Henry in ODI cricket. He has taken 10 wickets at 13.6 from four matches and snared four wickets on two occasions against Sri Lanka there in December 2015.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's exciting to play some cricket down here.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We haven't played much here [this home summer]. It will be a good wicket as it usually is. Hagley is always looking great at this time of year."</p>

        <p>Anyone worried the Crusaders might tread on a snare and take the battling Blues lightly need not bother.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Forget the fact the Blues haven't won a New Zealand derby since round one of the 2016 season, a gander at coach Scott Robertson's 23 to play the Auckland-based Blues at Eden Park on Saturday night tells you all you need to know. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Unlike some New Zealand franchises, the third-year Crusaders coach hasn't hogtied some of his All Blacks by easing them into the new season. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We've obviously gone the opposite way around. We want to get the combos right early," Robertson said</p>

        <p>Despite Sam Whitelock, Kieran Read and Codie Taylor being on extended leave, and centre Jack Goodhue ruled out with a groin strain, Robertson has named 13 players who have been involved with the All Blacks in his 23, including 10 in the starting side. </p>

        <p>"He [Goodhue] had a slight, tight groin, and just with the length of the season, and doing the right thing by him, we gave him the extra week to come right. He potentially could have played, but the best thing for him is to make sure it's 100 [per cent]," Robertson said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Crusaders' XV includes openside flanker Matt Todd, who will captain the back-to-back champions until Whitelock returns during round five, and his vice-captain - second-five eighth Ryan Crotty. </p>

        <p>Ennor predominantly played centre through secondary school, and for the New Zealand under-20s, but was mostly utilised on the wing during his rookie season with the Crusaders last year. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>However, fresh off a Mitre 10 Cup campaign with Canterbury in the midfield, Ennor got the nod over veteran Tim Bateman. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"He's more than comfortable," Robertson said. "As you know, Braydon's speed is his greatest strength, and he's a big strong boy and he's ready to go.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's tough on Tim Bateman, he is looking strong as well. But that's the great thing about having depth, you have to have tough conversations and someone has to miss out."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Third-year Tasman lock Quinten Strange will start in place of Whitelock, while the returning Whetukamokamo Douglas will play No 8 with Read unavailable until March 16. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Loose forward Ethan Blackadder was unavailable for selection due to a shoulder injury, although Robertson noted it wasn't serious. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>With Seta Tamanivalu now earning his coin in France, nephew Manasa Mataele has been rewarded for an impressive pre-season and will start in the No 14 jersey, opposite try-scoring gun George Bridge. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Will Jordan, who missed his entire rookie campaign with concussion last year, has been named on the bench and will make his Super debut when Robertson injects him into the fixture. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Obviously a prodigious talent. You could see in the pre-season, his ability to beat players and take opportunities, he's definitely got an eye for a gap and a bit of extra speed. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"He's a good local boy, he always dreamed of being a Crusader, so it's a dream for him this weekend."</p>

        <p>The response to the Give a Little page established on February 6 by two Rotorua volunteer fire fighters has left them, in the words of one, "excited, overwhelmed, humbled".</p>

        <p>The pair had just one request before speaking to <em>Stuff</em> - anonymity.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There's a number of reasons, their volunteer work across other sectors being one, but it's neatly summed up by one of the volunteers in four words.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's not about us."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The pair said they were moved to establish the Give a Little page at a point when no Mayoral fund, or Red Cross fund, had yet been established. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They also wanted to do something as they couldn't be there, on the ground, themselves.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Wherever the need is, we don't need a reason to help," said one. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They didn't need a reason in April 2018 either, when Ngongotaha was deluged with rain and flooded. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They sprang into action then too, raising thousands of dollars to purchase more than 150 'grab n go' bags to stricken residents, work recently acknowledged by Rotorua Civil Defence chief and former Rotorua Police Area Commander Bruce Horne. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The pair said they plan to travel to Nelson once the fund closes on February 28 to hand over the cash, and have already been in talks with Nelson Mayor Rachel Reese's office, Nelson Tasman Civil Defence, fire brigade and voluntary groups on the ground.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They're the people, they said, who really know what's needed, and where. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"How the dollars are divvied up, we don't know yet," one said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The fund is set to close on February 28, and they said there are two reasons for that. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Firstly, it will get the cash raised to where it's needed faster.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The second reason is less pragmatic, but equally essential.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Transparency to donors. One clean payment," one said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We wanted to be transparent. One cheque, it's very clear in the donors eyes."</p>

        <p>Last June, council passed a development contribution policy that included increased charges, separate living area calculations, and a phase out of central city remission over three years.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Developers warned, at the time, the increased cost would drive them out. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's all making it pretty marginal for them and they are saying it's probably easier to do it somewhere else," Neale said.</p>

        <p>Yeoman Property Group developer Andrew Yeoman said the development contribution policy is having a direct affect on his future decision-making.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The policy is at odds with council's own central city transformation plan to breathe life into the CBD.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's completely contrary to what they are trying to achieve by introducing this policy," Yeoman said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Apartment blocks currently consented will still be built but it's no longer feasible to start a new development, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We've got 34 units ready to be built over the next 24 months but we're not able to purchase anymore land with the current development contribution policy.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It is a fact that because of that policy we are not able to develop any more because it doesn't make financial sense."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Council staff will report back to elected members in April on a review into the impact of the policy on development.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Hamilton Mayor Andrew King said property prices tripling in the CBD in the past two years and the high construction cost was behind the sales slump.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"When property prices have tripled, on property suitable for apartment development, that's going to have a huge affect on whether apartments are viable going forward," King said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Growth must pay for growth - ratepayers shouldn't shoulder the cost of private business, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>And removing the development contribution policy would make CBD properties even more attractive.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"If we took our development levy fees back off again, property prices would just move to fill that void."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Waikato Chamber of Commerce chief executive Chris Simpson said the policy is seen as draconian.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It is becoming far too costly to start a development coupled with the fact that we've got a market out there where we've got a lot of development happening at the same time from previous developments. It is making it quite tight," Simpson said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Mayoral hopeful councillor Angela O'Leary said she saw it coming.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"In 2013, we worked with the development community and took a strategic view of how we could entice developers to turn their vision and their investment to our CBD and it was working," O'Leary said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Reverse the council decision and keep the remission going, she said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"This is just the tip of the iceberg. It's only a matter of time before other changes to the policy under the pretence that growth pays for growth will come home to roost."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Property Council Waikato Branch chair Brian Squair​ said there has been concern for some time over council's approach to development.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We have not been impressed by the council's attempts to shift blame onto the development community by suggesting that ratepayers are subsidising growth," Squair said. "While this is politically appealing, it is simply not true.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"The development community already fully funds many local assets in the areas they develop and then gifts them to the council as they are completed. These assets include local roads, water mains, sewers and stormwater systems that are all designed and constructed to the standards set by the council."</p>

        <p><strong>OPINION: </strong>I'm one of those rare teachers: a man.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>I started in Early Childhood Education nine years ago when I came to New Zealand from the United Kingdom where I was a qualified primary school teacher for 20 years. As well as being a male teacher, I'm openly gay and in a very happy relationship.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>I couldn't get a primary post in Auckland because I was told I didn't know the New Zealand curriculum. So I slipped into ECE. But if it wasn't for the joy of the children I've worked with, I wouldn't have stayed in this profession.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>I think I had a lucky escape from primary teaching because the workload is horrendous, whereas in ECE I can leave the centre and forget about it. So I wasn't ever tempted to go back. The ECE private sector is in shambles and the only properly run organisations seem to be the kindergarten associations.</p>

        <p>At one centre I was played off against another teacher who I struggled to work with, so rather than move me to another room, I was ground down until I eventually left.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>I've worked at a centre where money was the sole objective and the management team allowed people to come in for free so they could claim a government subsidy. Not a penny was invested in the centre, toys were often McDonald's freebies, and we had no decent art paper, only surplus from a local printer, but most of it was gloss so it was useless for paint. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>I haven't met many other male ECE teachers, but my advice is to be absolutely sure you want to teach in ECE, because you might face some very cautious managers.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When applying for a permanent post, check out the centre carefully. Are the children engaged in activities such as free play, art, construction? If there's a lot of running around and screaming then they're probably not fully engaged.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Are the teachers happy? Are they engaging with children in a positive way? Are are standing around, chatting and doing nothing? If so, that's a sign of poor management or just plain laziness. Most of all, listen to your gut instinct. If it doesn't feel right, it won't be.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>My last bit of advice: don't panic. Choose where you apply carefully, look up the ERO report available online, and read between the lines. Centres are desperate for male teachers, but many managers don't understand that a man's approach to children is different to a woman's. Children love rough play and being tickled, so don't feel inhibited about touching them, but do make sure you're in the classroom or playground with others. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Just be yourself and don't compromise your teaching philosophy.</p>

        <p><strong>OPINION:</strong> What can be done to prevent car chases?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Having identified that the major group of offenders in this area is young males, we need to next identify not why they run from the police, (clearly that is because they don't want to get caught), but why they think they can successfully outrun the police and why they have so little concern for their lives and those of their passengers.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>We also need to find why so many young males are so overconfident in their ability to drive, as this is often the cause of a number of our road crashes.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>READ MORE:<br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/110148244/preventing-fatal-chases-lets-look-at-why-kids-are-running-from-police" target="_blank">Preventing fatal chases: Let's look at why kids are running from police</a><br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/109919195/young-brothers-killed-after-fleeing-car-explodes-in-huge-ball-of-fire?rm=a" title="">Young brothers killed after fleeing car explodes in 'huge ball of fire'</a><br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/109998255/getting-our-kids-back-into-sport-could-keep-them-from-crime?rm=m" title="">Getting our kids back into sport could keep them from crime</a></strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>I believe that much of this stems from the use of computer games like Grand Theft Auto, which not only encourages the user to steal cars and drive recklessly but also provides an unrealistic expectation of survival through some horrific situations</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In almost every computer game the player plays until they lose a life. Thereafter they go through some sort of restart routine where they get a new life starting just where they left off and try to find another way forward.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Perhaps these games are influencing our young drivers to believe that they are more capable drivers than what they are in real life and that it's not a problem to lose a life.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Perhaps we could use this fascination with games to the benefit of the community by requiring both newly qualified drivers and foreign drivers to undertake driving simulator training before taking their place on our roads.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>For many years in New Zealand being able to drive a car has been seen as a rite of passage, a transition from childhood to adulthood. There is a lot of pressure on young people, both from peers and parents, to pass through this stage. We need to change that first.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>I was astounded by the news of the Christchurch mother's <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/110082337/mother-of-boys-killed-in-triple-fatal-crash-does-tribute-burnout-for-sons" target="_blank">burnout video</a> on social media and must assume that this reflected the attitude about driving that she had passed on to her children. That also is the stuff we need to change.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A lot of our young people do not choose what they eat for lunch because their parents don't trust them to get it right, however those same parents and family members then expect them to miraculously be able to make decisions about how hard to push the accelerator, and whether it's wise to run or not.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>We need to teach our young people to actually understand and assess risk. Then to make thoughtful decisions about safety of both themselves and others.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>However we need to do this in a safe environment where they can learn from their mistakes without harm to themselves or others. A safe environment like a driving simulator. This must also be entertaining to get them to actually want to participate.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The current licence system requires a person to pass a theory test to obtain a learner's permit. We could also require them to undertake a certain number of hours on a simulator game with a final simulator test before they progress to driving on actual roads as part of that.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Any such simulator must be based on New Zealand roads as they are so different from anywhere in the world. It should allow for a range of scenarios including near miss and actual collisions resulting from the driver's actions. It must be as realistic as possible to show the horrors of a real road crash.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The initial stage could be set up on an Internet basis so that you could be driving with friends logging in from your own console at home. Good driving technique, collision avoidance, etc all clock up points while poor driving, near miss, and actual crash events all deduct points.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A crash event would result in a lengthy stand down for all parties to simulate the real life effect of such an event.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A high score table would provide an incentive to good driving.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The testing stage would be undertaken in a more advanced simulator at a driver testing centre with previously unseen scenarios and require a specific pass rate.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>This could also be incorporated into the foreign driver scheme with rental car operators required to administer one of the test simulations to any foreign driver before releasing a vehicle to them.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Car insurance companies might assist with the costs of the simulator for the rental operator if it could be seen to reduce claims.</p>

        <p>A house that had its floor area doubled without the builder getting consents may have to be partially torn apart during checks to make sure it is safe to live in.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The unregistered builder, Richard James Easther, was fined $6500 in the Palmerston North District Court on Thursday for building without a consent.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Judge Lance Rowe said a fine of $12,150 would have been appropriate, but reduced it due to Easther's limited means.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Easther, a sickness beneficiary with few assets, moved in to a house on Watershed Rd, Bunnythorpe, having entered into a relationship with someone else who lived there in 2010.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>READ MORE:<br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/110078659/man-faces-massive-fine-for-doubling-houses-floor-area-without-consent?rm=a">Man faces massive fine for doubling house's floor area without consent</a><br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/bay-of-plenty/109931125/papamoa-village-park-fined-24750-for-carrying-out-work-without-consent?rm=a">Papamoa Village Park fined $24,750 for carrying out work without consent</a><br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/104008981/unlicensed-builder-used-forged-council-consent?rm=a">Unlicensed builder used forged council consent</a></strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He did extensive work on the house between 2011 and 2018, putting in a new kitchen, bedroom and covered deck, as well as other internal renovations.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The work doubled the floor area of the house, but he got no consents.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Paul Greig, appearing in court for the Manawatū District Council, said a consent for the work would have cost $4500.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Retrospective consents were not granted, but the owner of the house was working toward getting an application of acceptance – effectively a statement declaring the house was safe to live in, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>However, some of the work Easther did meant parts of the house would have to be torn out to ensure work was up to code.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Easther had helped, though, by providing X-ray images of the foundations, Greig said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Defence lawyer Phillip Drummond said Easther had no previous convictions and was honest about not getting consents as soon as the council got in touch.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Furthermore, the owner of the house was also aware of the lack of consents, he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Easther had since split with the owner and moved out, so was not in a position to do remedial work.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The judge said the maximum fine for this kind of offending was increased from $100,000 to $200,000 in 2013, showing how serious it was.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>As a builder, albeit now unregistered, Easther knew his obligations, the judge said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"You carried out the work and you deliberately did so without a consent."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The owner of the house would likely lose money from pulling part of the house apart to see if it was safe, the judge said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Ninety per cent of Easther's fine will go to the council.</p>

        <p>Mental health advocate Mike King has been named Kiwibank 2019 New Zealander of the Year.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>King, the television personality and comedian turned mental health educator, received the award from Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Wednesday night. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Chief judge of the awards Cameron Bennett said King was a "wonderfully complex and compelling Kiwi".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"His determination to shine a light on the effects and impacts of mental health, particularly among Māori and young people, is as uncompromising as it is confronting," Bennett said. </p>

        <p>"Mike's in your face, brutally honest and hugely funny, he doesn't back down."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's that courage and resolve that makes him so relatable to at-risk rangitahi that others can't reach, Mike King is a great New Zealander of the Year," Bennett said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Working alongside other mental health professionals, King has been the driving force behind many initiatives helping shift the way New Zealanders think about mental health, drawing on his own experiences of mental illness. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In 2018, King's I Am Hope tour saw him and five other speakers tour schools, churchs and community centres across the country on scooters to raise awareness about New Zealand's youth suicide rate. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>King was raised in Whenuapai, north of Auckland, and i<a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/102457214/national-portrait--mike-king-is-on-a-very-different-standup-tour" title="">n an interview with Stuff last year</a>, he said he grew up with no self-esteem, no self-worth.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"All I ever wanted from my dad was for him to be proud of me … I always felt like I wasn't good enough. I would describe my mum as having bipolar. You never knew what you were going to get – the beautiful, loving mum or the terror mum."</p>

        <p>Although humour was his ticket to social acceptance and would become his livelihood, he spoke of being an angry man struggling with his demons, which included two suicide attempts.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It wasn't till he was 45 that he sought help for his mental well-being. He got clean, ditched the drink and drugs and went on to start his radio show, the Nutters Club, on which callers discuss mental health issues.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>His work with kids, which began in 2013, was a voyage of discovery.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But it didn't sit well with his stand-up career.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I didn't realise how toxic stand-up comedy was to my mental well-being. We look for things that p... us off and put a funny twist on it but you're always looking for the negative.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"By saying the stuff I was saying, it actively encouraged others to say it too. I had to make a choice. I could carry on doing what I was doing or I could carry on with this new love that I'd found."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Comedy lost out and King has since become the voice of mental health.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He sat on the Government suicide prevention panel but quit last year, saying the draft plan was deeply flawed.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I knew the day I started on the panel in 2015 that I was going to be leaving when they started talking about funding, when they talked about starting with a blank piece of paper."</p>

        <p>World War I medals and hand-carved Māori artefacts were among the loot found during a drug search in Thames.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The recovered treasures are just a few of $500,000 worth of artefacts still missing from a private collector's home.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Waikato police executed search warrants on Wednesday, finding methamphetamine and large amount of cannabis in the process, police said in a statement.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Four firearms, including three shotguns, a large array of ammunition and more than $9500 cash were seized during the search.  </p>

        <p>But the "priceless" 100-year-old artefacts, including WWI medals, old coins, and a hand-carved Māori adze were an unexpected find.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Whalebone and greenstone patu, pendants, brooches, childrens' taiaha, muskets and artwork were among the artefacts taken from the collector's home in January, Detective Senior Sergeant Steve Ambler said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We got a very small amount of those things [back]," Abler said. "But we got something back. And it gives us a line of inquiry for where more stuff might be. It's something." </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The collector had been on the way to the police station to pick up the artefacts on Thursday afternoon. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It was all priceless treasure with huge cultural and personal value, Ambler said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We were surprised to find them there. We weren't looking for those particular items at that address." </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A lot of "suspicious activity" reported by locals eventually led police to the property where the artefacts were recovered.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It was found along with other items reported stolen around Thames, including a lawn mower, quad bike, chainsaws, tools and fishing rods, stolen from outside the Ngatea Pub.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Police had expected to find those items - but not the artefacts. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>And it wasn't clear what the offender wanted with the historical items, Ambler said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I wouldn't have thought it would have had a lot of retail value on the black market." </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A person police had spoken with claimed to have been gifted them, Ambler said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A 33-year-old Thames man was due to appear in Thames court on Thursday, charged with a range of offences.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Police wanted to thank members of the community who saw and reported activity they knew wasn't right, Ambler said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He also urged more people to report suspicious activity. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"If people are accepting this types of items without verifying where they've come from, they're contributing to the problem. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We are committed to reducing the supply of drugs and reducing criminal offending. This is a significant result for the new year and will have a positive impact on reducing harm as we head into 2019.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I actively encourage people to contact police to let us know about people involved in the supply of drugs, or accumulating wealth and assets with no apparent legitimate means."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>If you, or someone you know is using drugs, you can seek help by contacting your local GP, by ringing the Alcohol and Drug Helpline on 0800 787 797, or texting 8681 seven days a week to speak to a trained counsellor.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Anyone who wishes to give information anonymously can do so by ringing Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>

        <p>It was Valentine's Day on Thursday, but Wellington Phoenix coach Mark Rudan wasn't ready for commitment.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He wouldn't say he will be at the club next season, to see out the second year of his contract, nor would he say he won't be at Western United, the new franchise he has been linked with in numerous reports.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>What he did say, was that he needs to send a Valentine to his wife, Sylvia, who lives in Sydney with their teenage sons, Luke and Adam, and therein lies the rub.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/a-league/110023794/the-sacrifice-mark-rudan-made-by-moving-to-wellington-to-coach-the-phoenix" target="_blank">Rudan told <em>Stuff</em> last month that the distance between him and his family had taken its toll on them all</a>.</p>

        <p>He said he wouldn't have taken the Phoenix job in the first place, if he'd known how hard it was going to be, and if he wants out because of that, he will attract a lot of sympathy - even if his exit would threaten to undo a lot of the positive change he has inspired at the club.</p>

        <p>Rudan's bosses, chairman Rob Morrison and general manager David Dome, <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/a-league/110422622/wellington-phoenix-actively-working-to-keep-coach-mark-rudan-long-term" target="_blank">have both invoked the coach's integrity</a>, when asked about his future, in what appears to be an appeal to the fact that he signed a two-year contract last May.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Anybody that knows me will you tell you the same thing," Rudan said on Thursday, when asked what he made of those comments.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"First and foremost, I'm most honourable to my family. It's as simple as that. You can take it however you want, but that's the start of it and the end of it."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>With wanting to be closer to his family clearly the biggest factor in Rudan's refusal to commit to seeing out his contract in Wellington, a return to Sydney would make sense, if his wife and kids feel unable to uproot themselves, rather than a move to new club in Melbourne, if that is indeed on the cards.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/a-league/110401194/wellington-phoenix-warn-western-melbourne-away-from-coach-mark-rudan" target="_blank">Morrison told the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> last month that Rudan "won't be at Western Melbourne" next season</a>, and it was notable that his certainty wasn't echoed by the coach himself.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Asked whether he would rule out being the coach of Western United, who are joining the A-League next season, Rudan first avoided answering the question then said: "I respect the question and I hope you'll respect my side of things too as well".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Asked before that whether he would commit to being at the Phoenix next season, Rudan said: "I think I have spoken enough about it. There's enough dialogue going on between myself and the football club and at the right time we'll speak about that".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A coach having issues he needs taken care of before he can make a commitment is not unusual, but them coming to the fore when that coach has more than half the length of his contract left to run is.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>As those talks between the club and Rudan take place, his family situation will be front and centre, but it is only one of two factors that will influence whatever decision he makes. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I've got two teenage kids who need their dad around, and dad needs them around as well, but I bought into this and we made a decision. I've also said before if I thought it was going  to be this hard, then I probably wouldn't have taken it on. That's reality.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"At the same time the club also understands that I want a proper project and I want to build on this, I'm not going to sit back and rest on my laurels. If things that have been done in the past continue on that way, then I won't be here. They need to improve, everything needs to improve."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The sixth-placed Phoenix play the second-placed Melbourne Victory on Friday night at Eden Park, <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/a-league/110520744/wellington-phoenix-raise-possibility-of-record-crowd-for-their-return-to-eden-park?rm=m" target="_blank">where a crowd well in excess of 15,000 is expected</a>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They will be without Tom Doyle who has suffered a knee injury and is set to be out for three weeks, while the Victory won't have striker Ola Toivonen, who is injured, and midfielder Terry Antonis, who is suspended. </p>

        <p><strong>?:</strong> In the spirit of Valentine's Day, are you willing to commit to being here coaching the Wellington Phoenix next year?<br> <br> <strong>MR:</strong> (Laughs) An even better start, good stuff, which reminds me, I've got to send my wife a Valentine's message, so I think that's much more important.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>?: </strong>So you're not willing to commit to being here and seeing out the second year of your contract?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>MR:</strong> I respect your questions, I think I have spoken enough about it, there's enough dialogue going on  between myself and the football club and at the right time we'll speak about that. Right now it's about  Eden Park, the attraction, it's about the momentum we are building and the Auckland faithful are coming out to support us in large numbers and that's much more important.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>?:</strong> You're playing against Melbourne Victory, are you able to rule out being the coach of Western Melbourne next season?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>MR:</strong> We're playing Melbourne Victory, it's a big game, we've had two games against them, we've led twice against them as well, and we want to turn that around, we want to turn a draw into a win in front of our home crowd for the first time,because we've done awful well against the champions, not many teams go to Aami Park and get the results we've gotten so far, so here at home we certainly want to turn that around and make sure we win the game.</p>

        <p><strong>MR:</strong> Like I said, I respect the question and I hope you'll respect my side of things too as well.</p>

        <p><strong>?:</strong> I know you don't like the focus on you, but there is a lot of focus because of what you've created, what you've helped to create this year. When would you like to make this decision - because of what all the fans are thinking and because everyone's wondering because of what you've helped create, I guess is why there's focus on it?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>MR: </strong>I respect your line of questioning. There are so many different ways to go about getting an answer, and I do respect that, and I think it's fair as well, it's a fair question to have. Right now, I've spoken to my players, I've told them the situation, we're fully focused, it's no different to Sydney FC a couple of years back, when there was a lot of talk about contracts with the players  and everybody else surrounding the club. We want to stay in this moment, we are together in this as well, and that's probably the most important thing right now, because as long as there is no disruption with the playing group and the staff, [it's okay]. That underlines everything, underpins everything, that's the platform for where we are right now. As long as that continues on, everything else will take shape.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>?: </strong>You must be aware that you've brought a lot of players to the club, you have great relationships with them, so what you do [influences] what they do, to a degree, and that makes it doubly important in terms of next year?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>MR:</strong> Maybe so, maybe not, I don't know. Yes, I have strong relationships with my players, and the people at the football club, and my staff as well, but like I said, they're going to be put on hold. I'm very up front and honest with my players as well, and there are talks going on behind closed doors, with the club. I've heard the club and I'm going to be hearing more from them, but at the same time, I'm putting forward my case. I've made it quite clear and public as well, I did two stories with a journalist in Wellington and I said yesterday take it how you want. I've got a situation, a personal situation that I've got to resolve, and pretty soon as well, I've got two teenage kids who need their dad around, and their dad needs them around as well, but I bought into this and we made a decision. I've also said before if I thought it was going  to be this hard, then I probably wouldn't have taken it on. That's reality. At the same time the club also understands that I want a proper project and I want to build on this, I'm not going to sit back and rest on my laurels. If things that have been done in the past continue on that way, then I won't be here. They need to improve, everything needs to improve.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>?:</strong> Is it fair to say you are looking for a greater commitment from the Phoenix, from New Zealand Football, so that you and your family can make a greater commitment to New Zealand and to Wellington?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>MR:</strong> Yeah, perhaps. But I think I've answered what I needed to answer in terms of that. I really want to focus on the players and I want to focus on Victory. There will be a time and place for all this, and I assure you at the right time I'll make it quite known, because I am pretty open as you've seen in the past since I've been here. There's nothing to hide as far as I'm concerned, the truth is the truth and I'm very open in making sure that people understand what goes on. First and foremost my players and the football club, then you guys. I understand how it works with you guys as well, I've sort of been in the business too, so I know that. It's important that the messages do come out because you guys play an important role as well.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>?:</strong> When [chairman] Rob Morrison and [general manager] David Dome have been asked about your future, one of the things they've both brought up is your integrity. I think Rob called you an "honourable, straight-up guy," David Dome called you "an honourable man". What do you make of them going so quickly to your integrity when asked about your future?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>MR:</strong> Anyone that knows me will tell you the same thing, and I keep saying, first and foremost, I'm most honourable to my family. It's as simple as that. You can take it however you want, but that's the start of it and the end of it.</p>

        <p><strong>OPINION:</strong> A novice politician hailing from the New York borough of Queens gains enormous media attention and a huge and wildly passionate following in part by lobbing irregular critiques at the news media.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Donald Trump in 2015? Yes. But also Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, circa 2019.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Their backgrounds, gender and - especially - their politics are different, but the Republican president and the outspoken freshman Democratic congresswoman from New York share at least one similarity: Neither has been shy about using social media to pummel the press. And like Trump, Ocasio-Cortez has been cheered on by millions of followers when she does so.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Ocasio-Cortez has squared off on Twitter against such varied media outlets as the New York Post, The Washington Post, Politico, the Hill newspaper, CBS News, Fox News and Glenn Beck's BlazeTV for statements she deemed offensive, inaccurate or just tone deaf. And that was just in her first two weeks as a member of Congress.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>READ MORE:<br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/109760567/alexandria-ocasiocortez-slams-fauxoutrage-over-fellow-democrats-comments?rm=a">​Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slams 'faux-outrage' over profane Donald Trump rant</a><br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/109750642/conservatives-attempt-to-smear-us-congresswoman-with-dancing-video-backfires-badly?rm=a">Bid to embarrass US congresswoman with college dancing video backfires badly</a><br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/108673232/alexandria-ocasiocortezs-clothing-criticised-in-her-first-days-in-us-congress?rm=a">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's clothing criticised in her first days in US Congress</a></strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But there is big difference: Ocasio-Cortez seems to respect the role of the news media, even as she criticises it. Her jeremiads tend to be surgical rather that the blunt attacks that Trump has aimed at the mainstream media. To date, she hasn't described journalists as "<a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/104712806/trump-brands-media-as-the-biggest-enemy-of-the-united-states" target="_blank">the enemy of the American people</a>".</p>

        <p>On the other hand, she has banned reporters from covering her, just as Trump has. But the congresswoman has on occasion doled out praise to the mainstream media (MSM), something nearly unthinkable with Trump. "Public radio is great!" she tweeted late last month. "As is @ProPublica, @frontlinepbs & a great deal of other incredible outlets worth our support."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Journalists probably liked this, too: "The biggest threats to journalism right now are tech monopolies & concentration of ownership," she tweeted after <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/world/110375122/vice-media-joins-buzzfeed-in-slashing-australian-jobs" target="_blank">BuzzFeed, HuffPost and other news organisations announced layoffs</a>. "Healthy democracy *requires* high-quality journalism."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But Ocasio-Cortez, like Trump, is pugnacious in the face of perceived slights by news organisations. After she criticised CBS News' hiring practices, National Journal political editor Josh Kraushaar tweeted that Ocasio-Cortez shared Trump's habit of being a "media scold". She let him have it with a mini-lecture on Twitter about race, concluding, "It's not about "quotas." It's about understanding the country you're living in."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The exchange apparently didn't persuade Kraushaar to change his original opinion. "Like President Trump, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is a master of the muck, using the platform to ... debase our discourse with catchy put-downs instead of engaging in serious debate," he said via email. "Those qualities make her successful on social media, but not necessarily in Washington."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He added, "I welcome good-faith criticism from readers and colleagues, but when a member of Congress uses their power to send a social media mob against their critics, it's an abuse of power."</p>

        <p>Ocasio-Cortez's staffers declined to discuss their boss' approach regarding the media for this article. A spokesman, Corbin Trent, responded to a lengthy list of questions with a one-sentence reply: "I think the Congresswoman has spoken for herself plenty on this topic."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Ocasion-Cortez - or @AOC to her 2.8 million Twitter followers - came out swinging again last month after news organisations wrote up her appearance on <em>Late Night with Stephen Colbert</em>. During the programme, Colbert asked the 29-year-old representative how concerned she was when her fellow Democrats tell her to "'wait your turn, go slow, don't ask for so much so fast right now'".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Colbert then framed his question this way: "On a scale from zero to some, how many f---s do you give" about such comments?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Ocasio-Cortez formed her hand into a circle, smiled and said to applause and laughter, "I think it's zero."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The next day, she lit into the Hill, which accurately summarised its story by using Colbert's language in its headline: "Ocasio-Cortez: I give 'zero' f---s about pushback from other Democrats."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: "I actually didn't say this, so while I know 'brown women cursing' drives clicks, maybe you accurately quote the whole exchange instead of manipulating people into thinking I said this sentence instead of just the word 'zero.'" The Hill's article did, in fact, quote the exchange.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Hill's editor, Bob Cusack, stands by the coverage. "Our headline and article was accurate, but in the world of politics, there's a lot of give and take," he said. "The congresswoman objected to it, and that's her right."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She also snarked at Politico, which ran a similar headline, and at the New York Post, which she wrote not only ran with "the false quote, but (added) an angry photo to boot. ... This is how news hysteria develops out of nothing at all."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The response hints at another way in which Ocasio-Cortez is like Trump: She sometimes misstates or exaggerates facts, and is reluctant to own up to it when called on it.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After The Washington Post's Fact Checker column handed Ocasio-Cortez four Pinochios, the lowest rating for factuality, for her misleading claim that US$21 trillion (NZ$31 trillion) in Pentagon accounting errors could fund two-thirds of the projected cost of universal health care, Ocasio-Cortez clapped back in an interview on CBS' <em>60 Minutes</em>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Asked about this dubious statement, she replied, "I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually and semantically correct than about being morally right," an ends-justifies-means approach that drew some criticism.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She offered an even more convoluted and no more contrite response to the fact-checking of her statements about "living" wages, including her assertion that Walmart and Amazon are "paying people less than the minimum wage." (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey Bezos owns The Washington Post).</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Glenn Kessler, editor and chief writer of the Fact Checker, rated her statements three Pinochios, effectively "mostly false".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Alerted by aides that Kessler's column was forthcoming, @AOC replied with pre-emptive sarcasm. She tweeted, "Me: 'I don't think billionaires should concentrate wealth while employing people who are sleeping in cars working a zillion hours to survive.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Next day: 'That will be TEN PINOCCHIOS to Ocasio, "zillion" is not a number and I found someone who sleeps in a tent, not a car.' "</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Last week, Ocasio-Cortez stirred some honey into her vinegary comments about the news media. She tweeted a clip of herself being interviewed on MSNBC and praised <em>Meet the Press</em> moderator Chuck Todd for hosting "a thoughtful 20 min conversation that wasn't hung up on conflict, but exploration".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Hard to imagine Trump doing that.</p>

        <p>You couldn't help but raise an eyebrow when seeing Orbyn Leger's name at No 10 instead of Damian McKenzie when scanning through the Chiefs team for Friday night's Super Rugby opener against the Highlanders in Hamilton.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Chiefs coach Colin Cooper on Wednesday <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/super-rugby/110558512/brodie-retallick-leads-inexperienced-chiefs-team-for-opener-against-highlanders" target="_blank">said a minor ankle injury had ruled out McKenzie</a> – not New Zealand Rugby requesting he was among the All Blacks stood down this weekend.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>McKenzie's absence leaves the Chiefs desperately short at first five-eighth with injuries to the All Black's potential replacements: Tiaan Falcon (Achilles), Jack Debreczeni (abdominal) and Marty McKenzie (hip), while returning veteran Stephen Donald wasn't deemed ready to start after only joining the squad this week.</p>

        <p>Leger started seven games in a row for the Blues last year at centre alongside All Blacks Rieko Ioane and Sonny Bill Williams, but he didn't retain a contract after his first Super Rugby season.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>So, after finishing his third Mitre 10 Cup campaign with his home province Counties Manukau, Leger was welcomed back to the wider Chiefs squad for pre-season this summer, having played for the development team in 2017.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Leger, who switched to represent New Zealand's under-20s in 2016 and 2017, has spent virtually all of his professional career at second-five or centre since his Counties debut in 2016, but he suddenly finds himself starting at No 10 after injuries have once again hurt the Chiefs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Counties coach Darryl Suasua said the role would not unsettle Leger after he played first-five at school and at club level for Karaka during his rise up the ranks, although he admitted that Super Rugby was, obviously, a class above. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"He was [first] selected in New Zealand's under-20s to cover that position, so he initially started off at 10," Suasua said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"This is a new level for him but, for something so young, he is one of our senior leaders. He's a quiet leader but, when he speaks, everybody listens. He'll certainly be able to step up."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It was at Counties where the versatile Leger, who also played fullback for the Blues development team last year, was moved into the centres. His form for the Steelers caught the eye of former Blues head coach Tana Umaga.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Added Suasua: "When Tana initially called me about him, it was to see if he could cover the outside backs. They were aware of his pedigree and the fact that he's a very good, smart player."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Leger's father Gus, a former Counties player, was teaching at Wesley College but he moved south, aged 13, to board at Hamilton Boys' and was first-five for their champion First XV side in 2014 alongside prop Ayden Johnstone, who will make his Super Rugby debut for the Highlanders on Friday.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After playing for Samoa's under-20s at the 2015 World Rugby Championship, Leger changed allegiances to New Zealand for the next two global junior tournaments and he started at second-five in every game when the Baby Blacks won the world title in 2017.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Leger cracked Super Rugby in 2018 – first playing for the struggling Blues in a 24-10 win against the Sunwolves in Tokyo last April – and now an unexpected Chiefs debut at first-five has come along. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>His left foot could be Super Rugby's first kick of 2019. Leger will step forward on the biggest stage across town from where he starred as a schoolboy.</p>

        <p>One demanding bride decided to uninvite omnivorous "murderers" from her wedding.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The bride wanted a "vegan wedding" and didn't want any meat-eaters present, but instead of just offering a vegan menu, she gave a number of family members and friends the flick.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Some family members were told they are not invited to my wedding because we don't want to host murderers at our wedding which is supposed to be one of the happiest days of our lives," the unnamed bride posted to a Facebook group named Vegan Revolution.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The post explained how she and her partner have been "consistently attacked" for being vegan, and they didn't want to put up with it on their special day.</p>

        <p>"When I broke the news to them, all I got was attacked because I don't want the weight of having people that still kill animals (the very beings we are trying to protect) at my wedding on my conscience," the post read.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She posted in the Facebook group hoping to receive some comments of support from people who have gone through a similar experience, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/andl11/this_lady_banned_all_nonvegans_from_her_wedding/?utm_content=timestamp&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_name=0753dfee648b43b7a31abcbd50771d14&utm_source=embedly&utm_term=andl11" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the post was then shared to Reddit</a> where around 3,500 users weren't so sympathetic.</p>

        <p>Newly appointed Chiefs skipper Brodie Retallick will head into his side's Super Rugby season opener with a few wise words from All Blacks captain Kieran Read floating in his head.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Retallick was last month named co-captain of the club with Sam Cane for this year's campaign, though with the latter sidelined by a neck injury it's the world-class second rower who leadership responsibilities will fully fall to on-field, starting against the Highlanders at FMG Stadium Waikato on Friday night.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The 27-year-old with 75 tests to his name and 98 Super Rugby matches under his belt is a natural inspiration to his team-mates during an 80 minutes, and deputised as captain on return from injury in last season's final-round game against the Hurricanes in Hamilton, when both Cane and Charlie Ngatai out. But he admits preparing as the skipper is a new kettle of fish.</p>

        <p>"It probably makes it a bit more nerve-wracking, to be fair, it's a bit harder to switch off when you've got to think about a few more things," he said. "But at the same time it has been enjoyable."</p>

        <p>Cane - who has co-captained the side the past three seasons - has been an obvious point of guidance, but Retallick said he also chatted to his national skipper Read - an opponent at this level at the Crusaders of course, but a man more than happy to share some pointers.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"When I found out, we were up in Auckland in the January promo window for the All Blacks, so I just went and had a quiet word to see if he had any tips for me," Retallick said. "He had some good advice. I'm sure he's qualified for the job," he quipped.</p>

        <p>While deciding on options from a penalty kick will be one main task, it's also the conversing with the referee which is another, for Retallick - one who doesn't shy away from a bit of niggle on the park - to consider.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We haven't actually touched on that too much... but I've got a fairly good idea - just don't yell at him," he jested.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's definitely something I've probably had to think a little bit about - not getting frustrated - but I guess it just comes with the job.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Obviously I've tried to walk towards it, and I am excited by it, and I'll try and not let it burden me, over-think it and slow me down."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Chiefs couldn't afford that, not with how green the rest of their lineup is. While the forward pack has a bit of experience to it, the backline is largely new-look, save for returning veteran Stephen Donald, who will back up Orbyn Leger off the bench, after the former Blues midfielder was handed the keys to the No 10 jersey amidst injury-hit first-five ranks.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Orbyn's been great, he's been playing really well [in pre-season]  and making some good decisions," Retallick said, while noting 35-year-old Donald "knows how to run a ship".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"He's been good. Obviously it's a lot to learn, or re-learn, in a week - a lot of the stuff is pretty similar to what he has already experienced here, so I guess that helps. But when he's come into the team he's taken control, as we know he does."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Retallick also confirmed Leger will be entrusted with goalkicking duties, with Shaun Stevenson to take the longer shots.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>What's also foreign territory for the Chiefs is getting their season underway at home. Remarkably, this will be just the second time in the last 12 years they have hosted a round-one match. The last occasion also happened to be against the Highlanders, and the Chiefs lost that match but went on to claim their maiden Super Rugby title.</p>

        <p>Rev up your Holdens and ignite your Falcons, a tour group looking to rekindle its glory days is calling for mad car enthusiasts. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Manawatū's collectable car club tours the lower North Island once a month, but founder Rod Davenport says it's more of a social club for like-minded petrol heads.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The club started in 1992, but almost disbanded shortly after its 20th anniversary, with membership plummeting to 13 people. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Instead of closing the club, Davenport helped resurrect it and it now boasted 60 members dispersed from Wellington to Whanganui. Although, several of its members were not active and did not take part in the monthly tours.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>READ MORE:<br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/news/95354762/kiwi-routes-in-north-and-south-in-new-global-epic-drives-book?rm=a">Kiwi routes in north and south in new global Epic Drives book</a><br> * <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/news/88518680/fords-nextgeneration-mustang-leaked?rm=a">Ford's next-generation Mustang leaked</a></strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>That's why Davenport and fellow member Peter Robinson are on a recruitment drive for owners of the region's oldest, greatest and shiniest collectable cars. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Davenport's car is a 1974 3-litre metallic brown Ford Capri he imported from the United States 10 years ago. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Before that, he had a 1939 Chev Coupe and a 1930 Model A Tourer, both of which had been restored down to the last nut and bolt. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Sitting in Robinson's garage are a 1929 Ford Model A and a 1973 Mercury Cougar. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Palmerston North man has been fascinated with cars since he was 16, when his brother's friend gave him a 1937 Ford Coupe. "I've loved them ever since." </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Member Laurie Cocker has the oldest car in the club's armoury, a 1906 Cadillac. The 113-year-old beauty may only reach speeds of 30 to 40 kmh, but that hasn't stopped Cocker taking it to Cape Reinga and Bluff four times.  </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It took him four days to get to the bottom of the South Island and Davenport said Cocker still drove it everywhere. </p>

        <p>Palmerston North mayor Grant Smith and MP Iain Lees-Galloway see potential for the national amalgamation of polytechs to strengthen the city's reputation as a centre of education excellence.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Palmerston North-based polytech UCOL, which also has campuses in Masterton, Levin and Whanganui, will be affected by a proposal, announced by education minister Chris Hipkins on Wednesday, to merge the country's 16 institutes into a single entity.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Three key ambitions; merging New Zealand's polytechs, creating a new vocational education funding system, and making industry training organisations responsible for 140,000 trainees and apprentices to better align on and off-the-job education, aim to prepare the system for a future economy in which Kiwis are expected to retrain throughout their working lives.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Lees-Galloway said the whole point of the proposals was to improve the provision of vocational education in the regions.</p>

        <p>Lees-Galloway said while some polytechs could not carry on as they were at the moment, UCOL was one of the strong ones which could provide lessons on what worked well.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He said there would be stronger regional leadership with business, iwi, schools and councils influencing what courses were provided locally.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Smith said while change was always difficult, he encouraged people to make submissions and to trust the consultation process.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"In Palmerston North, the system is not broken.</p>

        <p>​UCOL's students' association has welcomed the potential overhaul, provided students still have a voice.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Association of Students at UCOL president Karla Davis was at Parliament for the announcement and said she supported the proposal because something needed to happen and institutes couldn't keep getting bailed out by the Government.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's a positive in the sense that the ministry is wanting to overhaul the curriculum. If you study in Palmerston North but move to Hawke's Bay, your studies and qualifications are going to be recognised [at another institution]."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Davis would be making a submission during the consultation process and encouraged the rest of the executive and other students to do so as well.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I'd like to see where the student voice is going to be in this whole process. That wasn't made clear [on Wednesday] and I'm just a little bit concerned how much the student voice is going to be heard in this."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The polytech sector lost $53 million in 2017, and four institutes – Greymouth's Tai Poutini Polytechnic, Wellington's Whitireia and WelTec, and Unitec in Auckland – received $100m in Crown bailouts last year.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In late 2018, all polytechs' finances were worse than forecast and most were "not expecting a major material turnaround in fortunes for 2019", a Cabinet paper  said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But UCOL had been performing well financially and student numbers were healthy. Davis said it would be interesting to see how the funding would work between successful institutes and those that had struggled. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>UCOL had 6500 students last year and numbers were tracking towards 7000 for this year.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Its chief executive Amanda Lynn and chairman Ben Vanderkolk were also at Parliament for the announcement. They were still digesting the proposal but Lynn said they were confident about UCOL's future.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"UCOL will participate in the consultation process and believes in the importance of regional vocational training, work skills that build careers, support for the wellbeing of local communities, and the substantial contribution this makes to the New Zealand economy.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"UCOL has more than 400 highly skilled personnel and is performing well, with 450 more students in 2018 and a financial surplus of approximately $1m," Lynn said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Hipkins said at a time when they were facing critical skill shortages, too many polytechnics and institutes were going broke.</p>

        <p>Leon MacDonald doesn't mind admitting he's feeling just a little nervous, and that it's got nothing to do with picking a 36-year-old Ma'a Nonu as his starting centre for his first proper rugby game back in New Zealand in nearly four years.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The new Blues head coach is actually relaxed about Nonu's selection as starting No 13 for Saturday night's Super Rugby season opener at Eden Park. It's other factors, including that his coaching debut at this level is against a Crusaders side he spent the entirety of his playing career with (122 games between 1997 and 2009), that have MacDonald just a little on edge.</p>

        <p>And, really, who could blame him? His toe is dipping into new waters as a coach, and turbulent ones they've been for this franchise. Now he's charged with the rugby equivalent of turning round the Titanic.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>If that's not bad enough, the first game is against the back-to-back champs and a team whom, if New Zealand Rugby didn't know better, you might say owned the Blues.</p>

        <p>For those keeping score at home, the Crusaders have won their last eight straight against the boys from the big city, and have not lost on a visit to Auckland since 2014.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>What was once a rivalry has now become an embarrassment.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>MacDonald said, after unveiling a lineup heavily impacted by the All Blacks' pre-season absence and requirement to balance minutes through the early rounds, that he was feeling both excited and nervous.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Double champs and the reputation of a lot of titles over the years … they're the team to beat. It's an exciting way to start and it adds a little bit of extra flavour with myself being down that way a fair bit. It's a great start.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"There will be a few nerves from everybody involved. It's been a really good pre-season, we've worked really hard and you're just hoping the performance reflects the hard work you put in. As coaches you just want to see these guys go out and perform to their potential."</p>

        <p>Those nerves, MacDonald confirmed, will even extend to Nonu who runs out in a midfield partnership with in-form Auckland provincial skipper TJ Faiane for the first time. The 103-test All Black hasn't played in New Zealand since 2015, and admitted early this week that he has ambitions of pushing for a spot back in the national team.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"He's a smart guy, he's been around for a long time, and he doesn't need pep talks," said MacDonald when asked his message to his one-time All Blacks team-mate. "The impressive thing with Ma'a is he's craving feedback and wants to make sure he's still learning.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"He'll be as nervous probably as the guys making their debuts. It's a big game for him, there are a lot of eyes on him and I know he'll be excited about playing in New Zealand again and doing himself proud."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It's an interesting lineup MacDonald sends out, with three touring All Blacks in his starting XV and another trio on the bench as he contends with directives from above.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Rieko Ioane starts on the left wing and skipper Patrick Tuipulotu and Dalton Papalii take their places in the pack, with Sonny Bill Williams and giant props Karl Tu'inukuafe and Ofa Tu'ungafasi lurking on the pine. It's a powerful unit to bring on over the run home.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There's also a first start at this level for Northland's Tom Robinson, on the blindside flank; a first Blues appearance for Otere Back, who sat out all last year with a knee problem;  and a chance for Jonathan Ruru to stake the first claim in the competitive halfback position.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>​Akira Ioane, the talented No 8 on a mission to win over the national selectors, will also make his 50th appearance for the franchise in his customary position.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>MacDonald confirmed All Blacks protocols had factored into his selection. "We've got to manage their minutes as they return and it's been a challenge picking a squad knowing that players are on time restrictions. It will probably make for some interesting subs," he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He was asked about the chance to make a real statement first up with a victory over the defending champs. And it was here he maybe most showed the qualities that saw him fast-tracked into this role.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"You don't win or lose your competition in round 1," he replied. "We'll be real about that, whatever the result. We'll look at performance as a whole and make a decision on whether we were up to scratch or not."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Rome wasn't built in a day, nor the Titanic turned in a jiffy. The long haul starts now.  </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>AT A GLANCE</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>Blues:</strong> Michael Collins, Melani Nanai, Ma'a Nonu, TJ Faiane, Rieko Ioane, Otere Black, Jonathan Ruru; Akira Ioane, Dalton Papalii, Tom Robinson, Josh Goodhue, Patrick Tuipulotu (capt), Sione Mafileo, James Parsons, Alex Hodgman. <strong>Reserves:</strong> Matt Moulds, Karl Tu'inukuafe, Ofa Tu'ungafasi, Gerard Cowley-Tuioti, Matt Matich, Augustine Pulu, Harry Plummer, Sonny Bill Williams.</p>

        <p>While both Gemma McCaw and Honor Carter chose Auckland bridal designer Anna Schimmel to design their gowns, Hannah Laity selected Australian designer Pallas Coutoure to make her wedding dress.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"In terms of the style, Hannah wanted something romantic and feminine so the Pallas Couture team created a beautiful fitted style with a very full train. The strapless gown featured hand appliqué with three-dimensional silk leaves and crystal embellishment throughout," said Alice Moore, a spokesperson for Pallas Couture told Stuff.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"My dress was nothing like what I had initially thought I would end up wearing but it just turned out that the strapless style was the most flattering on me," said Hannah.</p>

        <p>At last there's something to play for in the game that kicks off the new NRL season.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The annual game that's marks the start of a new campaign, played by the Indigenous All Stars, used to be a pretty one-sided affair when it came to motivation.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Indigenous team played with passion, representing their heritage, but their opponents, either the NRL All Stars or World All Stars, were cobbled together sides, playing for nothing in particular.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>So it was a smart move to set up a new fixture between the Indigenous All Stars and New Zealand Māori team.</p>

        <p>"I know they've had games against each other in the past [2008], but to put an emphasis around it and put it on a big stage is awesome and I'm happy to be a part of it."</p>

        <p>Beale took a break from Warriors preseason training along with Tohu Harris, Adam Blair and Peta Hiku to be a part of this New Zealand Māori team.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Once it's over he'll be back in Auckland for his second year with the club and hoping that it's a better one for him that last year from a personal point of view.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He broke his leg during the ill-fated 2017 World Cup campaign and wasn't back in action until midway through last season.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Last year coming in halfway through the year and being new to the club, it was tough," he said. "Especially because the boys were on such a high when I came into the side.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"To be able to start pre-season from scratch with the boys, work on combinations has been great and the body is feeling really good."</p>

        <p>He has that versatility to allow him to seamlessly play in both positions, but doesn't know where most of his appearances will be this year.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Obviously, it's always up to Mooks [Stephen Kearney, Warriors coach], he's been trialling us all around different positions in the backline.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"So I'm coming to training and still learning and all I can do is put my best foot forward."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It will be intriguing to see how the Warriors go this year, whether they'll continue to improve or regress. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Beale believes they've got the credentials to make 2019 a great year for the club.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I definitely believe we've got the potential," he said. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"There are 16 teams all trying to get the same prize, but we can keep putting our best foot forward as a team and work together.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I guess it's going to look a different team without Shaun [Johnson] there, but it does create an opportunity for someone else to fill that role, so it's exciting and if we can play to our potential we can go a long way."</p>

        <p>Kāpiti's information site will close this year, taking with it three jobs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The service would shut before the end of June and Kāpiti Coast District Council was unsure what it meant for the three people who worked there. The staff were told of the decision on Tuesday.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Low numbers of customers visiting or using the site's services meant it was not financially sustainable, Kāpiti Coast District Council spokesman James Jefferson said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>“Monitoring over the past months of how the i-SITE model is working has made it clear the cost of operating the site far outweighs the number of people using the services on offer and that’s not good use of ratepayers’ funds."</p>

        <p>Located at the Paraparaumu Coastlands complex, the i-SITE provides visitors to the district with maps, brochures and advice, as well as helping with bookings.</p>

        <p>Palmerston North residents in the suburb of Awapuni are teaming up to help locate a couple of roaming dogs that killed a cat.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The cat owner, who did not want to be identified, said the dogs had come on to the property early one morning, trapped the much-loved 10-year-old cat in the garage, and attacked.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She said they were two large dogs, one brown and one black, that were often seen running uncontrolled through local streets.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>City council chief customer and operating officer Chris Dyhrberg confirmed there had been a string of dog complaints from the Nottingham Ave area in the past 18 months.</p>

        <p>There were complaints in August and December 2017, and in January 2018, and the most recent was on February 1, about a cat being killed.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Officers were not able to positively identify the culprit, and further patrols in the area had not spotted any roaming dogs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The cat's owner has delivered fliers to letterboxes in the area alleging at least two other cats had been killed recently.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She urged people to pass on any information they could to "stop this happening to someone else's beloved pet".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Another resident, Merrien Larsen, said she worried for her own cat's safety, and kept her indoors at night.</p>

        <p>"It's making life very hard for people."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Larsen said she understood animal control officers could not take action unless they could be certain they had identified the right dogs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She said the dogs always seemed to be on the move, running together, which made it difficult to get a photo or make a call before they moved out of sight.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"But we are hoping people all around the area who have seen the dogs might be able to help identify them."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Allowing a dog to roam was an offence under the Dog Control Act and could carry a $200 infringement fee.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A dog attack on a domestic animal could lead to a warning or to the owner's prosecution and a fine of up to $3000, and the court would make an order for the dog to be put down unless there were exceptional circumstances.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The council could also classify a dog as menacing if it considered it could pose a threat to any domestic animal because of observed or reported behaviour. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Menacing dogs had to be muzzled when in public, and be neutered.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Dyhrberg said members of the public should not attempt to capture a dog themselves because of the risk they could be bitten, but should call the council.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p> </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p> </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p> </p>

        <p>Bill Cosby is shedding light on his day-to-day life behind bars and, according to his spokesman, it's not so bad.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Despite the circumstances, [Cosby] said, 'This is an amazing experience,'" Andrew Wyatt, the 81-year-old actor and comedian's representative, said in an interview.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Cosby also said he has "no remorse" and never will, and compared himself to the likes of Martin Luther King, Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and other "political prisoners".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"My political beliefs, my actions of trying to humanise all races, genders and religions landed me in this place surrounded by barb-wire fencing, a room made of steel and iron," Cosby later added in a statement about his prison experience so far.</p>

        <p>"I now have a temporary residence that resembles the quarters of some of the greatest political prisoners... I stand upright as a political prisoner and I smile. The truth is strong."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in a Pennsylvania state prison following his April 2018 conviction for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home outside Philadelphia in 2004.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Right now I'm his only visitor outside of his attorneys, and that's the way he wants it," Wyatt said, noting that Cosby's wife Camille hasn't seen him in prison because "he doesn't want her to visit him".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But Wyatt said that prison has accomplished something his wife has tried to do for 55 years - get Cosby to stop drinking coffee. The spokesman also noted that the former Jello pitchman has lost weight after giving up bread and dessert.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When asked how Cosby was surviving behind bars, Wyatt explained that Cosby was a mentally strong man.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"When I visit him, it's nothing sad about it," Wyatt said. "He's not sad. He's not remorseful because he did nothing wrong."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In his statement, Cosby explained "why I have no remorse and will never have remorse".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He reiterated his argument, which he has made for more than three years and through two trials, that he was not charged in 2005 in connection with Constand's allegations and he later settled her civil suit against him for nearly $4 million.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He believes he was later prosecuted by a corrupt district attorney and judge, "not for justice, but for their political aspirations," and launched a campaign to get a state judicial ethics board to investigate the judge who presided over his trials.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Cosby is also appealing both his sentence and conviction.</p>

        <p>After being on the back foot throughout the first half, Tottenham took complete control once Son netted two minutes after the break to make it four goals in as many games.</p>

        <p>Son celebrated with a trademark Tottenham handshake, but went over to Serge Aurier rather than Jan Vertonghen – the provider of the cross.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I feel sorry," Son laughed after the game alongside Vertonghen, "because I didn't run to him and I ran to the other side."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Vertonghen got his own chance to celebrate as Tottenham scored two late goals inside three minutes to take a commanding lead to Germany for the return leg on March 5.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Vertonghen raced into the penalty area and arrived at the back post to volley in Aurier's cross in the 83rd minute.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Technically he's just unbelievable," Son said of Vertonghen, who was playing at left wingback rather than in central defence.</p>

        <p>With Dortmund struggling, Fernando Llorente scored the third in the 86th minute when he got a slight touch with his head to turn in Christian Eriksen's corner.</p>

        <p>It is the third setback in a week for Dortmund, who were knocked out of the German Cup by Werder Bremen and then drew with Hoffenheim in the league.</p>

        <p>While Dortmund have a five-point lead in the Bundesliga, Tottenham are five points off the pace in the Premier League in third.

        <p>The defending champions needed a little help from the video assistant referee to overcome the spirited Dutch outfit in their first leg round-of-16 match and take a big step toward the quarterfinals.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Substitute Marco Asensio's late strike put Madrid in a strong position going into the second leg on March 5.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Real, winner of the last three Champions Leagues, recovered in the second half after being outplayed by underdog Ajax before the break at a packed Johan Cruyff Arena, when the hosts had a goal disallowed by VAR.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>​Asensio, a 73rd-minute substitute, was unmarked at the far post as he tapped in a cross from the right by Dani Cavajal with just three minutes of regulation time to go.</p>

        <p>Ajax had looked on course for a draw when Hakim Ziyech shot under Thibaut Courtois in the 75th minute to cancel out Karim Benzema's opener 15 minutes earlier.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Amsterdam team went into Wednesday's (Thursday NZT) match in something of a form crisis since the Dutch league's winter break. Their previously solid defence crumbled late last month in a 6-2 defeat to arch rivals Feyenoord and Erik ten Hag's team slumped to a 1-0 defeat on Saturday (Sunday NZT) to Heracles Almelo.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But Ajax shook off their winter form dip before the break, pressing Madrid high up the pitch, combining well with slick, short passes and looking like the team that qualified second in their group behind Bayern Munich.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Real went into the match brimming with confidence from a run of six wins and one draw in their last seven matches. But they only really hit their stride in the second half, proving more clinical in front of goal.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Ajax, four-time European champions who last won the title in 1995, dominated the first half and looked to have taken the lead only to have VAR rule out Nicolas Tagliafico's 37th minute header because Dusan Tadic was offside standing in front of Courtois. It was the first time VAR has been used to disallow a goal in the Champions League.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Kasper Dolberg came close to levelling again in stoppage time, but Courtois stuck out a hand to block his effort as Madrid captain Sergio Ramos was made to work hard for the win in his 600th match for the club.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Benzema struck a powerful shot past Andre Onana on the hour after a strong run from the left by Vinicius Junior to put the 13-time European champions ahead.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Madrid's lead lasted 15 minutes before David Neres crossed from the left and substitute Dolberg let the ball run to Ziyech, who shot low under Courtois.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Ajax, in the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time since 2006, had lost their last six matches against Madrid. But the hosts started confidently and Tadic nearly gave Ajax the lead, his 26th-minute shot hitting the post after beating Courtois.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Real created little in the first half. Vinicius Junior came closest when he cut in from the left wing and shot on target only for Onana to palm the ball over the bar.</p>

        <p>Singer-songwriter Ryan Adams is denying allegations made by seven women of alleged sexual misconduct.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/ryan-adams-women-sex.html"><em>The New York Times</em> is reporting </a>that the septet and more than a dozen associates "described a pattern of manipulative behaviour in which Adams dangled career opportunities while simultaneously pursuing female artists for sex".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"In some cases, they said, he would turn domineering and vengeful, jerking away his offers of support when spurned, and subjecting women to emotional and verbal abuse, and harassment in texts and on social media."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Among those quoted in <em>The Times </em>article is Adams' ex-wife, <em>This is Us </em>star Mandy Moore, who said "music was a point of control for him".  She alleged that he convinced her to fire her manager, took control of her music career and became psychologically abusive.</p>

        <p>"His controlling behaviour essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time – my entire mid-to-late 20s."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers also detailed her relationship with Adams. After discussing marriage less than a week into their relationship, he became "obsessive and emotionally abusive".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The article states that the women have started supporting each other after they recent discovered their "similar experiences".  </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"What you experience with him – the treatment, the destructive, manic sort of back and forth behaviour – feels so exclusive," Moore said. "You feel like there's no way other people have been treated like this."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The alleged incidents include Adams exposing himself to an underage girl. She highlighted a letter that Adams wrote to her in November 2014 that said, "I would get in trouble if someone knew we talked like this".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He later wrote: "If people knew they would say I was like R Kelley lol."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Forty-four-year-old Adams, who has recorded 16 studio albums (including a reimagining of Taylor Swift's <em>1989</em>) and been nominated for five Grammys during his own two-decade-long career, said through his attorney Andrew B. Brettler that he denied "ever engaging in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Brettler also said Adams denied all of<em> The Times</em>' "extremely serious and outlandish accusations", adding that the musician remembered their interactions differently to how the women in the article did.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He also called Moore's characterisation of their time together "completely inconsistent with his view of the relationship", adding that he was supportive of her "well-deserved professional success".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After the article was published, Adams himself responded on social media, describing the picture the article painted as "upsettingly inaccurate".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false. I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I though was underage. Period.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes. To anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally, I apologise deeply and unreservedly.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"As someone who has always tried to spread joy through my music and my life, hearing that some people believe I caused them pain saddens me greatly. I am resolved to work to be the best man I can be. And I wish everyone compassion, understanding and healing."</p>

        <p>When Julien Baker was 12 years old, she realised music could serve as a catharsis.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I went to a hardcore show and saw a performer screaming into a microphone instead of singing. I remember thinking, 'that's what I want to do, for many reasons,'" the 23-year old says, speaking from Nashville in the US.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>And that's exactly what she did.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Memphis-born musician released her debut album <em>Sprained Ankle</em> in 2015, its success immediate. It was a record loaded with painfully raw lyrics that dug into you, slowly, like a growing kind of pressure. Those words were further intensified by Baker's sparse, sometimes empty, production.</p>

        <p>Then came Baker's 2017 follow up <em>Turn Out the Lights</em>. The production was more layered, but the record remained chilling.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>For those arriving at Baker's music for the first time, her honesty can be confronting, and oftentimes, her songs sound as though they demand silence.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But Baker - who is "terrified" of performing - says she feels most at ease when the audience is singing along with her.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's like a cosmic joke that it's something for my job, that I perform every night but I'm terrified of it," she says, half laughing, half serious.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Sometimes I get nervous and I'm not very talkative, but I like when crowds are a little bit chatty because it makes me feel much more relaxed. It feels like conversation, it doesn't feel like there's a lot of scrutiny on me as a performer that I need to deliver something."</p>

</div>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>If belting your heart out at a show isn't your cup of tea, that's cool too. She knows "everybody experiences art differently." She just loves with people sing along, because it never stops amazing her. In her words, it's completely and utterly "astounding."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A fear of performing begs the question, how did touring with boygenius - her critically-acclaimed collaboration with Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Daucus - compare?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Getting to play with other people, especially two other women who I admire so so much, was unreal," she says. The experience added so much value to Baker's own experience, she warmly describes it as her "favourite musical experience of all time," she says.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When the small run of shows they did together ended, Baker admits it was a "very sad" time.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We all cried at the last show, onstage, but it was happy tears."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Most people assumed it would only be the one EP. There was never an expectation from fans there would ever be a follow up, but Baker comes bearing good news: "We're all very adamant about making more music."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After asking for further clarification ("More music together?"), Baker confirms, "More music together, as Boygenius."</p>

        <p>But that's a bridge to be crossed when each of the three women finds time in their equally packed out schedules. In the meantime, Baker is trying something different with her songwriting.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I derive most of my inspiration from personal event that happen within my life, but I'm trying to take those and dissect what's going on in my life, the good and the bad and the turmoil into an assessment of human relationships and start to almost do character studies of people in my life and what our core desires are. I just like people. I think human beings are the most fascinating thing on earth."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She pauses for a brief moment. "That sounds so wuu wuu."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Sure, maybe to some, but a Julien Baker fan would expect nothing less. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><em><strong>Julien Baker's New Zealand tour was cancelled earlier this week due to "personal matters".</strong></em></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p> </p>

        <p>West Indies quick Shannon Gabriel has apologised to <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/110551800/joe-root-tells-rival-bowler-theres-nothing-wrong-with-being-gay?rm=a">England captain Joe Root for their confrontation in the third test</a> but is adamant he did not use homophobic language in an <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/110580130/cricket-body-charges-west-indies-player-over-antigay-slur">incident that has cost him a four-match ban</a>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Gabriel did not contest a level-two charge for personal abuse, but has told sources he did not use homophobic language, despite Root being picked up by stump -microphones saying: "Don't use it as an insult. There is nothing wrong with being gay."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>One of the umpires is believed to have heard the abuse and after it became clear Root would give evidence, Gabriel decided not to challenge the charge and was banned for four ODI internationals and fined 75 per cent of his match fee.</p>

        <p>Gabriel's apology came at the end of play on Tuesday (Wednesday NZT) when England had wrapped up victory. After what had been a generally good-natured series, the teams shared a drink together.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Gabriel was awarded three demerit points, taking his tally to eight and triggering a suspension for two tests or four ODIs, depending on what comes first for the player. There was no mention in the International Cricket Council statement of what was said that led to the ban.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Gabriel has not played ODI cricket since 2017, so was expecting to miss two tests against India in July, which would have ruled him out of international cricket until October, but the West Indies argued he was in contention to play in the one-day series against England.</p>

        <p>He was left out of the squad for the first two matches, but selectors said in a media release this month that he was under consideration to play the latter half of the series. Since the squad was announced,</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Keemo Paul and Rovman Powell have pulled out injured and Gabriel was in line to replace them.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Last week, the ICC banned -Sarfraz Ahmed, the Pakistan captain, for using racist language and it is clear there is now a zero-tolerance policy towards abusive sledging. With stump microphones turned up and increasingly picking up what is said, players will have to be careful or more will be banned.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The West Indies board accepted Gabriel's punishment, but has told the ICC it expects it to be consistent in applying its punishment, especially as the Ashes, which are staged this summer, have been tarnished in recent years by personal abuse.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Turning up stump microphones has not been popular with many players and coaches, who feel heat-of-the-moment expressions of anger that are later regretted by individuals should be treated sensibly by the authorities.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I've said it once before, no I'm not in favour of it and I'm not going to change my mind," said Trevor Bayliss, the England coach when asked about stump microphones. "If stump mics were around a few years ago, there would be some blokes seen as holier than thou who would have been in trouble as well.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I think it should be [turned] down. I know there are people who think the opposite and think it is good for the game, but sometimes, in the heat of battle, things are said when guys, given time to sit and think about it, would give themselves a kick up the backside."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>England travel to Barbados on Thursday (Friday NZT) to begin preparations for the one-day leg of the tour which starts with a warmup game on Sunday (Monday NZT) before the first ODI at the Kensington Oval on Wednesday (Thursday NZT).</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Bayliss has warned Ben Foakes he faces a lengthy spell out of the rest side after deciding the experiment of batting Jonny Bairstow up the order at No 3 is over.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>​Foakes was dropped for the third test despite averaging 41.50 from five tests and keeping immaculately in difficult conditions this winter.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>England wanted to accommodate Bairstow in the side, but he has averaged 27 since being promoted to five last May and developed a problem with being bowled through the gate. He remains first choice for now, but Foakes is putting pressure on Bairstow for his place in the side.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"He [Bairstow] is working on it and he has to continue to work on it," said Bayliss. "He is aware of it."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When asked if Bairstow back down the order permanently was bad news for Foakes, Bayliss replied "yes unfortunately".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He added: "The good thing about Foakes is that he is a very good keeper, and I think we've discovered someone who can put pressure on that middle order from a batting point of view."</p>

        <p>Quinovic has taken back the management of its Te Aro, Wellington, office from its franchisees.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The property management office has had a string of high-profile problems.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It ran advertisements in August last year that were criticised for being <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/106219880/quinovic-distances-itself-from-adverts-that-outrage-renters">degrading to tenants</a>. One appeared to question landlords on whether they were charging too little rent, by asking them if they were financing their tenants' social life. Another said tenants would "hate" Quinovic.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In January, the firm was forced to admit it was running <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/110085573/quinovic-admits-facebook-reviews-fake-after-google-reviews-from-new-york-pawn-shop-fans-emerge">fake Facebook reviews</a>.</p>

        <p>Chief operating officer Paul Chapman said at the time there was no record on the Quinovic database of property owners or tenants associated with alleged fake Facebook reviews.  Fake reviews had also been found and "flagged" on Google.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>One tenant said dealing with the firm was the <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/106240371/quinovic-by-far-the-worst-experience-renter-has-ever-had">worst renting experience she had ever had</a>.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Now, Chapman has confirmed the franchisor has taken over the operation of the Te Aro franchise and appointed a staff member as general manager.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A franchisor owns a brand's trademarks and systems and allocates the right to franchisee businesses to operate within it.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Chapman referred to communication sent to clients and tenants, in which he said:</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We are currently in discussions with the existing property management staff, however, in the interim we ask that all queries relating to your property be directed to [the new manager] in the first instance.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Taking over the operations of the Te Aro franchise is not a decision that the franchisor has taken lightly and it follows two very public incidents involving the franchise; unauthorised advertising in August 2018 and more recently fake Facebook and Google reviews.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"We are hoping that the transition to group office management will be smooth and seamless but ask for your patience in advance with any transitional issues."</p>

        <p>Cutting out carbs might not be a good idea if you want to live a long life, according to a new study.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Research has shown the popular high-fat, low-carb dieting methods endorsed by a number of fitness influencers, trainers and celebrities, can shorten your life span.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The study - conducted by <em>Lancet</em> - found those who consumed less than 40 per cent and more than 70 per cent of their daily calories from carbohydrates were more likely to die. A balanced diet that doesn't cut out entire food groups and that includes carbs as 50 per cent to 55 per cent of your daily calorie intake, is the key to a longer, healthy life.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Researchers came to this conclusion by tracking the diets of 447,400 adults around the world (15,400 in the US) aged between 45 and 64.</p>

        <p>They recorded all information from the participating subjects and compared it to how long they lived. Out of all the participants, in 25 years there were 40,181 deaths across all groups they studied.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It wasn't just carbs that were the reason for shorter life span. Those who combined low-carb diets with high animal protein - lamb, beef, pork and chicken - were linked to higher mortality, as opposed to those who consumed plant-based proteins - vegetables, nuts, peanut butter, whole-grain breads.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The keto diet, paleo, Atkins, and Dukan all follow the same restrictive structure and force your body to use its fat stores as opposed to burning carbohydrates you eat.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/food-wine/recipes/94654155/following-a-ketogenic-diet" target="_blank">popular keto diet</a> calls for followers to only consume carbs that make up 5 per cent to 10 per cent of your daily calorie intake, which is significantly less than the desired amount highlighted by the study, and focus on eating fats and protein.

        <p>A Hamilton couple carried around a winning Lotto ticket in their wallet for days, not knowing they were millionaires.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The couple, who wish to remain anonymous, purchased a ticket from Countdown Dinsdale on Waitangi Day.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Unusually for them, they had not checked the ticket soon after the draw.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Last weekend, while enjoying burgers and chips by Lake Rotoroa, they remembered to check the ticket on an afterthought.</p>

        <p>"I pulled out our Lotto tickets and asked my wife to look up the winning numbers and read them to me while we are having lunch," the winner said in a statement.</p>

        <p>The couple were in disbelief and re-checked the ticket several times - passing it back and forth between them, he said.</p>

        <p>The news is still sinking in for the couple, who don't have any plans for their winnings yet.</p>

        <p>A grateful mum is thanking bystanders who rushed to her son's aid when he was struck by a cyclist, leaving him with serious injuries.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Lauren, from Wellington, took her two young children to Memorial Park in Palmerston North on the way back home from a trip to Napier. While he was playing, Lauren's 7-year-old son Amotai was hit by a teenage cyclist.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The crash broke Amotai's ankle and snapped his shin bone "clean in half". He had surgery in Palmerston North Hospital and spent three days there before returning home to Wellington. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The experience left Lauren shaken.</p>

        <p>"The adrenaline carries you through... then you're just in shock.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It's still hard to think about... It was horrible," she said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>On Facebook, Lauren, who does not want her last name used, thanked strangers for their kindness.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Lauren said writing her thoughts down was a way to "reframe" what had happened, and to try to take some positives out of the incident.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I wrote the post in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep... It was quite carthartic."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She said the help she received from people overwhelmed her, from the instant after the crash to the care her son received at Palmerston North Hospital.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In her post, she wrote how impressed she was with the paramedics who put "both me and Amotai at ease with their warmth and professionalism".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Lauren thanked the person who went to look for her young daughter when she was scared off by the arrival of the ambulance, while another lent her their iPad at the hospital to keep her entertained.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She said two women gave her their phone numbers in case she needed anything, as they knew she was from out of town.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Thank you, random people. Maybe we still do all look out for each other as a society after all."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The young cyclist and his family were deeply upset by what had happened and Lauren knew the incident was "just bad timing".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"He [the cyclist] showed such remorse through his bewildered tears it was impossible not to forgive him," she wrote.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Amotai will have to use a wheelchair until his full leg cast comes off. Lauren said he is doing half-days of school and has been playing with lots of Lego when he is at home. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The stop in Palmerston North was not initially part of Lauren's plans, as she was going to drive through Wairarapa to get to Wellington.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Amotai said to me he wished we had driven through Masterton."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>LAUREN'S POST </strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Now we've finally been discharged from Palmerston North hospital after<br> three days and it's clear Amotai will be fine (albeit in a wheelchair<br> for a little while), I want to take a moment to thank all of the<br> complete strangers who made the experience bearable:<br> <br> - The man who took my phone from me when it was clear I couldn't tell<br> the ambulance where we were as my mind wasn't working properly.<br> <br> - The other man who ran to the road so he could wave the ambulance<br> down and show it where we were.<br> <br> - The person that covered my son in a towel to keep him warm. I didn't<br> even see who this was; he was shivering on the ground and then next I<br> remember he was wrapped in the faces of his favourite Transformers.<br> <br> - The two separate women who gave me their phone numbers because they<br> knew I was far from home and 'in case I needed anything', and then the<br> one that followed up to ask if I needed anywhere to stay.<br> <br> - The woman who went and found my daughter after the ambulance<br> arrived: she's only five; she was scared and overwhelmed and had run<br> off to hide.<br> <br> - The cyclist who had sped down a hill and run Amotai over. He showed<br> such remorse through his bewildered tears it was impossible not to<br> forgive him. Forgiveness is less burdensome than anger, and the<br> cyclist made it easy.<br> <br> - The person at the hospital who gave my daughter an iPad to play<br> with. The other people for not judging me for letting a barefoot<br> five-year old wearing nothing but swimwear play on the aforementioned<br> iPad for hours. The man who plied her with jelly when she was<br> restless.<br> <br> - The nurse in ED that watched the children so I could go to the<br> bathroom and sneak to a vending machine.<br> <br> - The woman who then lent me $2.50 at the vending machine because my<br> card wasn't working and it was the thing threatening to send my stress<br> levels into orbit.<br> <br> - The staff at Palmerston North Hospital for making us comfortable, of<br> whom there are too many to single out. You can't fake that sort of<br> concern and caring.<br> <br> Most of all: the two paramedics for putting both me and Amotai at ease<br> with their warmth and professionalism. For their genuine concern<br> interspersed with well-timed jokes, and for coming back a few hours<br> later to the hospital to see if he was ok. I was too shell-shocked to<br> thank them properly at the time, but now the fog is cleared, I would<br> say this: I don't remember a time I've been so impressed. If it wasn't<br> for their calm, the threads of my sanity might have unraveled<br> completely that afternoon.<br> <br> Thank you, random people. Maybe we still do all look out for each<br> other as a society after all.</p>

        <p>It was a sunny Saturday in April 2017, but my grandmother's house was dark.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She was alone - chain-smoking in her dusty living room in Sao Carlos, Brazil, tan curtains drawn over the windows to better see the TV commentators rant over the state of the country - when the phone rang.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I've been looking for you for decades," the man on the other end of the line whispered in Italian. "You were my first love."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It had been more than six decades since my grandmother had heard the voice of Aldo Sportelli, now 82. She pictured his youthful face and wondered what he looked like on the other end of the phone. Aldo's voice trembled as he recalled the last time he saw her, speeding away from him on a train in southern Italy. Their stunted teenage romance left a mark on him, and he had spent years unsuccessfully trying to track her down.</p>

        <p>For 10 minutes they caught each other up on how their lives had unfolded - both married for half a century, my grandmother widowed, Aldo's wife in the last stages of Alzheimer's, kids, grandkids, careers - and of course they spoke of Polignano a Mare, the town where it all began.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I couldn't believe it," my grandmother told me over the phone that day. "You just don't think this type of thing will ever happen to you."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>MARILENA'S BIG ADVENTURE</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In 1951, when my grandmother, Marilena, was 15, she set off on her greatest adventure: a year-long trip to Italy with her grandparents. Her grandfather, Antonio Lerario, was an illiterate fisherman who, in 1885 at the age of 13, had left Italy for Brazil as a stowaway, his bed a sack of potatoes at the bottom of a ship. He joined thousands of Italian immigrants in Sao Paulo, Brazil's seedy industrial capital, where he slept under bridges and sold bags of rice on the street.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He eventually saved enough money to open his own warehouse and went on to create a multimillion-dollar cereal empire. His rags-to-riches rise became core to his identity: It was a story he would repeatedly recount throughout his life and even on his grave - the fruit of decades of planning - which featured a sequence of scenes that traced his unlikely ascent on bronze tablets.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After the end of World War II, he decided to return to Italy on a victory lap and invited Marilena, his Brazilian-born eldest granddaughter, to skip school that year and come along. In April 1951, the SS Conte Biancamano, an Italian ocean liner, departed the Brazilian port of Santos to carry 1600 passengers across the Atlantic.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The 14-day journey - my grandmother's first outside Brazil - marked her society debut. To prepare, she ordered dozens of dresses, plumped with tulle and showered with rhinestones. Guests aboard the ship changed outfits three times a day. Dinner was a black-tie event, and women would descend into the dining room wearing their best furs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>She was the youngest passenger in first class, which included counts, members of the Brazilian aristocracy and the archbishop of Rio de Janeiro. "It was all new to me," she recalls. "It was all marvellous."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>THE RICE TYCOON'S RETURN</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After two weeks crossing the Atlantic, the ship docked in Genoa. Marilena and her grandparents took a train to Puglia, the heel of the boot, where they found a country struggling to piece itself together. World War II had been over for six years, but destruction lingered. A castle at the edge of town still had blood stains seeped into the walls.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The rubble, though, could not dampen the bleached beauty of Polignano a Mare, her grandfather's hometown. The village is perched on hulking limestone cliffs on the edge of the sea. As a boy, Antonio would rise early to help his father catch fish and octopuses, slapping them into buckets and shaking them until they gave up their ink. They lived in a simple stone house in the centre of town. But now, as a returning rice tycoon, Antonio and his family would stay in the most famous hotel in the region: the Grotta Palazzese.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The hotel was three stories, with a terrace facing the sea. But its real gem lay 30 feet below. Underneath the hotel, scooped into a cliff, was a vast cave, lined with wooden planks that held a luxury restaurant. Visitors from around the world came to dine.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Marilena, who spent her days people-watching from the hotel terrace, was never allowed into the cave. After catching some local businessmen ogling her from the restaurant, her grandmother started shooing her to the kitchen as soon as the lunch rush began.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Even at 15 she exuded the kind of aloof, effortless glamour of a Hollywood movie star. Dark, pinned curls framed her face. She had heart-shaped lips, a dainty nose and a curious smile. Svelte with a tiny waist, she made any outfit look good.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Sequestered in the kitchen, she proved useful by helping the family who ran the hotel prepare meals. While slicing onions and peeling garlic, she picked up Italian and got to know the Sportellis.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Aldo Sportelli, two years her senior, was smitten. Lanky, with a shy smile, he would hang around the kitchen when he came home from school. "Ours was a relationship of kids," Aldo would tell me. "It was my first infatuation."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They spoke about their lives, their plans for the future. He wanted to become an engineer. She had no idea what awaited her when she returned to Brazil.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After school, Aldo balanced trays and served the glamorous patrons in the restaurant; my grandmother spent her nights listening as the music from the parties in the cave below lofted in the wind. Every now and then, Aldo joined her on the terrace to watch the sun set over the Adriatic, always under the watchful eye of a family member.</p>

        <p>As her year in Italy drew to a close, Aldo decided to make his move. One day, as she was going down the stairs to the kitchen, he went in for a kiss. Unsure of what to do, she slipped out of his embrace and rushed away.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>My grandmother's family was not happy with the budding romance. For a fisherman turned cereal magnate, the son of a hotel owner was not what he had in mind for the family heiress. Aldo's mother eventually sat him down and told him the social distances between him and Marilena were too large to bridge. "At that time, I thought they were right," Aldo recalls.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The two continued an awkward but flirty relationship over her last few weeks at the hotel. Before she left, she asked him to sign a keepsake memory book for her. He sketched her face and wrote, "Marilena, if you allow it, a friendship can be an enduring bond. Will it be that way with us? I hope so."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When it came time for her to leave, he went to the station and watched as the train pulled away. It was one of the saddest moments of his life, Aldo says. He waited until it disappeared into the horizon before turning around.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>LIFE IN BRAZIL </strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>My grandmother went to Italy a girl and returned to Brazil a woman. Her skirts clung tighter on newly developed curves, she wore silk stockings, her lips were coloured red and her eyes made up. In her trunk on her way home, she packed her very first pair of high heels.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In college, she met my grandfather. He was the president of the student centre where she spent her days surrounded by friends, playing guitar. By 1969, she was married with four children in tow.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Her marriage was a happy one, but my grandfather's jealousy somewhat contained her curiosity about the world. He discouraged her from playing guitar, lest it draw unwanted attention. It sat unused in a cupboard until she eventually gave it away. When they ate at restaurants, she faced the back to avoid other patrons' wandering eyes.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Shortly after my grandparents got married, they moved three hours away from Sao Paulo to a town in southern Brazil, where my grandmother found the conversation boring and the people tedious. My grandfather enjoyed small-town life, but my grandmother struggled to adjust. After he died, she gave up on the few friendships she had, preferring to spend half the year with my mother in the United States.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When she heard Aldo's voice on the other end of the line that day in April, she had been married for 52 years and widowed for four. She didn't know it yet, but one last adventure awaited her.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>SEARCHING FOR MARILENA</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>While my grandmother became a housewife and mother, Aldo Sportelli did as he planned and studied engineering. For most of his career, he would work on urban planning for local communities. In 1959 he met Beatrice, a friend of a friend, at a party. He married late, at 35. They had two children, Vito and Sabrina.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>For decades Beatrice suffered from depression, and the marriage was hard on Aldo. Their circle of friends was small, and they rarely travelled outside Polignano. After his mother died in 1995, he was filing through letters she left behind when he came across a familiar face in a white wedding dress: his beloved Marilena, on another man's arms. Her grandmother must have sent her wedding photo to the Sportellis.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I thought, 'Where is she? What did she do? How is her life?' " he recalls. "The thought that I would never again be able to hear from the young girl who captured my boyhood heart tormented me." And so began his search.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Aldo tried to reach the photographer who had taken the wedding photo, but he was long dead. Eventually, he came across an address under her name, but it was for a warehouse that had been passed down to her with no listed phone number. He emailed the mayor's office of Sao Paulo, asking for information on a Marilena Lerario. "We're a city of 12 million people," Aldo said he was told. "We can't help you."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Meanwhile, in 2012, Beatrice was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The Alzheimer's progressed quickly. She eventually barely recognised her children, and any emotional connection she maintained with Aldo and her kids dissolved.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Aldo dedicated his days to making sure Beatrice had what she needed, as her health deteriorated further. She refused at-home care from nurses and relied solely on him for her every need. He had only a few hours a day to himself, when she was sleeping and he could call a caretaker to watch her as he ran quick errands.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>'I NEVER FORGOT YOU'</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Finally, two decades after he started his search, he contacted the daughter of an old family friend who worked at the Brazilian tax authority, and she agreed to help. She found Marilena, who now went by her married name, and passed him her phone number. When Aldo phoned Marilena, it had been nearly a year since his wife had spoken a word. "I never forgot you," he told her on the phone that afternoon. My grandmother was speechless.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The next day, Aldo called again. He wanted to know more. What did her children do? What were her days like? "I don't even know what he looks like, and we are talking every day," my grandmother said to me that week on the phone. The problem rung familiar to my millennial ears. "Let's look him up on Facebook," I suggested.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Sure enough, Aldo Sportelli, at 82, had a Facebook account. My grandmother used Facebook mainly to share political ramblings from dubious sources and was shocked when, with the jab of a few keys, I pulled up Aldo's photo. Looking dignified sitting in a mahogany chair, wearing a red tie, he had white hair but the same sad eyes and shy smile he had at 17.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"He's handsome," my grandmother said when I showed her the photo.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When Aldo called again, she asked him to write her a detailed letter about his life. He scoffed at the idea. "Nobody writes letters anymore!"</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>So I suggested the most modern communication I could think of: a video chat. My grandmother had never done anything like it, but I promised to help with the logistics. The following weekend I went to her house for a family get-together and messaged Aldo to arrange the call. My family gathered around the living room, eager to catch a glimpse of him, the man my grandmother wouldn't stop talking about, as the phone rang.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>There was Aldo, in a blue sweatshirt, sunglasses slung around his neck, beaming. "You didn't use to be blonde!" he said. My grandmother burst into giggles.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>COMING BACK TO LIFE</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Aldo kept calling. Week after week he wanted to know how she was. He reassured her before she had surgery to remove a tumour and wanted to know how she felt when she came back from the hospital. "Have a safe trip!" he would say before she travelled to see my mother in Miami. "Let me know when you get there."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It is nice to have someone care about me again," my grandmother told me. "On the days he doesn't call, you know I actually miss him?"</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The messages soon grew rosier: heart emoji and photos of flowers. "For when you wake up: Good morning," he messaged once, when it was daytime in Italy but still dark in Brazil.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>My grandmother, who had spent the past few years shutting herself off from the world, came back to life. On their calls, her Italian flowed as though she had never stopped speaking it. She began dressing up for their virtual dates, putting on lipstick and fixing her hair. "Poor old man," she would say, as she excused herself from the family to talk to him yet again. "He has nobody."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In March 2018, it was Women's Day in Italy. Aldo painted Marilena's name in blue on the trunk of a blooming tree in his backyard. "Most men give their women flowers," messaged Aldo. "I got you a whole tree."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Marilena became the talk of the town. At parties, other widows and family acquaintances would pull me aside and say with a smirk, "I heard about your grandmother!" Her friends would tell the tale to anyone who would listen. The hairdresser, distant relatives - all knew the story about my grandmother and her Italian boyfriend.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The new romance split my family. My uncles were protective and wondered what his real interests were. But my mother was thrilled. "We have to take you back to Polignano!" she said. My dad agreed. My grandmother, however, rejected the idea. "He has a wife!" she would remind us, laughing the whole thing off.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Still, my mother was persistent. Soon, Marilena called Aldo with the news. "We'll be there for two weeks in September," she said. Aldo agreed she should come but said he was anxious. "I still haven't forgotten the first goodbye," he told her.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>'MY BOYFRIEND JILTED ME'</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In September, my grandmother landed in Bari, nervous but smiling, accompanied by my mother, my dad, my aunt (her eldest daughter) and me. She wore a festive purple-and-white flowery shirt and matching eye shadow. In one hand, she clutched her iPhone. In the other, she held a present for Aldo, wrapped in blue ribbon.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Aldo had agreed to meet us on the road to Polignano. But when my grandmother called to tell him she had arrived, he had bad news: He couldn't find anyone to care for his wife. She had taken a turn for the worse right before we arrived and had refused food for 10 days. He apologised and asked to meet in the morning.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Don't worry, I'll see you tomorrow," my grandmother said quickly. She hung up and tried to play down her disappointment. "It's better this way. It would have been too hurried to meet up for two minutes."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But in her distress she soon started to question the whole trip. "Why do these things happen to me, even in my old age?" she asked, marching straight outside and lighting a cigarette.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"He asked me if I smoke," said my grandmother, who has smoked a pack a day for as long as I can remember. "I said no. He hates smoking." She packed mouthwash in her purse to hide the habit. "My boyfriend jilted me, so I deserve a cigarette," she said, and laughed.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When we arrived at the hotel, a bouquet of pink roses was waiting for her. "Welcome to your hometown," Aldo had written on the card. "I hope you don't wait another 68 years to return."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Don't make it too big," my grandmother yelled at my mother through a cloud of hair spray. She woke up early to get ready for their meeting, and her hair had become a focal point. "It's not me," she declared after seeing herself in the mirror. "I want to look like myself."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Defeated, my mother went back to work, teasing the stiff curls lose. "How do I look? Do you like these sunglasses?" my grandmother asked. "They were popular in the 80s." After one last cigarette, she was ready.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>A HISTORIC MOMENT</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>We drove past miles of twisted olive groves as my grandmother fixed her shoulder pads and sighed. "It's interesting, isn't it? An old lady, seeing an old man," she said. "I don't know. The good thing is, I know through FaceTime he's got teeth and he isn't bald. He's got such a great mind. He's so cultured. He talks about the dukes and the counts, the owners of the city. The guy's intelligent. He has a great memory."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Aldo asked us to meet him at the church of San Vito, where Mass would soon be starting. The church resembled a stone fortress, with a bell tower rising over Corinthian arches overlooking the Adriatic.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When we pulled up to the entrance I spotted him. His back was curved, and with a cane in one hand, he clung to the arm of a younger woman I assumed was his daughter. I jumped out of the car. "Aldo? It's so nice to meet you!" The man nodded and smiled weakly.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>I peppered him with questions in pieced-together Italian and said my grandmother would be out of the car soon. "I'm sorry, I think you are looking for someone else," the woman next to him finally said. I was harassing the wrong old man.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Across the parking lot, leaning against his car, the real Aldo was waiting. With sky-blue eyes hiding behind silver Ray-Ban sunglasses, slicked-back hair and a tan jacket hanging loosely around his shoulders, he was as cool an octogenarian as I've seen. When my grandmother saw him, she leaped out of the car and walked toward him, her arms open. "So beautiful," he said, trembling as he hugged her. She blushed and introduced him to the family. "It's a historic moment, a miracle," he announced.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>We walked past iron gates and through the silent patio toward the chapel. Aldo held her hand in his. Both of them wore their wedding rings and matching hematomas. He helped her across the stone path to a set of wooden doors. As he opened them, light flooded the windowless chamber and revealed some 60 parishioners staring back at us. My grandmother let go of his hand immediately.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He walked in to find her a chair, and we stood in the back as the town's congregation tried to make sense of the family of strangers walking in late to Mass.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A devout Catholic, my grandmother has been trying to get the rest of the family to church for decades. "He's very religious," she said with a smile, as Aldo mumbled the Apostles' Creed in Italian and she did the same in Portuguese.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When it came time for the traditional peace offering, he held her hand again, but she pulled it away after a few seconds. She had been waiting for this moment for months, but the sudden audience made her nervous. Here she was, the other woman. What would this do to his reputation, my grandmother wondered.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>LAST CHANCE AT ROMANCE?</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>After Mass, we lingered outside, reluctant to say goodbye. My grandmother handed him two gift bags. He opened one to reveal a new iPhone - his was old and always cutting out in the middle of their conversations. "And this one is for Beatrice," she said, pointing to the second gift. He opened it to find a gray shawl. Aldo stared at my grandmother for a long time, tearing up and mouthing, "Thank you."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>We asked him out for lunch, but he said he had to go home and relieve the housekeeper who was watching his wife. So we went back to the hotel, and my grandmother sat in the living room, waiting to finally be alone with Aldo where they felt most comfortable: on the phone. And sure enough, as the sun was setting that evening, he called. My grandmother told him about her day, but it was as if an ocean still separated them.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>By the time she hung up, she seemed to have finally grasped Aldo's reality. They were both healthy, of sound mind and nearing the final years of their lives. Surely this was their last chance at romance. But while my grandmother was a free woman, with nothing binding her to Brazil, Aldo's past still gripped him. His marriage, a forgettable detail while on the phone, was proving a more formidable obstacle in person.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Sixty-eight years is too long," my grandmother concluded. "A whole life passed for him, and I didn't even see it happen, because I was on the other side of the world."</p>

    COURTESY OF MARILENA 
  </div> 
  <div class="nsImageCaption">
    A keepsake from Aldo Sportelli that reads "Marilena, if you allow it, a friendship can be an enduring bond. Will it be that way with us? I hope so." 
  </div> 
 </div> 
</div>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Aldo, who preferred writing his feelings to saying them out loud, sent her a message late that night reflecting on their encounter. "There we were, you and I, as if we had been good friends for 68 years, helping each other in sorrow and rejoicing together in joy," he wrote. "I thank God for allowing me the chance to be with you, be it for a gust of wind."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Over the next few days my grandmother and Aldo would meet for coffee daily, during the few hours he could get out of the house. My grandmother always made it a point not to text him first. When she did text him, she would run the messages by us to make sure they didn't look too desperate.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Inevitably, though, Aldo would arrange a get-together. "This is inconvenient, having to ask you to drive me to see him," my grandmother complained to my dad. "Marilena, how many times did you take me to the movies with your daughter?" he asked, referencing his teenage courtship with my mother. "Life takes turns."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Maybe I'll just wait and see him in paradise," she responded.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"You're being optimistic," my dad said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But when they did get together, my grandmother refused to be alone with him. "What would people think if they saw us together?" she said. "It looks bad." At first I laughed this off as an antiquated sense of modesty. But as the days went on, everywhere we went Aldo seemed to run into a different acquaintance.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Aldo Sportelli!" a friend would shout from across the street, making my grandmother cringe. "Who are they?" waiters would ask, looking at us, as Aldo paid the bill. "Friends," he would reply curtly.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>'YOU MAKE HIM HAPPY'</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>On one of their chaperoned dates, he brought his daughter and grandson. I was worried about what they would think of my grandmother, but all anxiety disappeared when we saw them across the parking lot. Tall, tan and blond, with her father's eyes, Sabrina, Aldo's daughter, immediately pulled my grandmother into a tight hug. My grandmother had brought her a necklace, which she put on right away. </p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Give Grandma Marilena a hug," Sabrina told Giorgio, her 12-year-old son. He did and tagged along as we went for coffee in a cafe on the outskirts of town, with photos of Bob Marley and Amy Winehouse on the walls.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They traded information about members of Sabrina's family whom my grandmother knew in their youth but Sabrina had only met in their final years. They joked about Aldo's mother's famous marmalade pies. "It's been a gift for Dad," Sabrina said when I asked how she felt about their relationship later that day as she gave us a ride back to the hotel. "It's a very happy thing. He's a victim of Mother's condition."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"But now he has a distraction, he has company," she told my grandmother. "You make him happy."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"I feel as though we've been living next to each other this whole time, on two contiguous, parallel roads with a single breath, meeting each other at the end of our earthly passage," Aldo wrote to me a few days into the trip. "Your grandma and I have pre-established paths. We have before us duties of responsibility. We cannot want things that will take us off track. But, you see, while we fulfill these duties, it is nice to hold the hand of those who are next to us on the path of life. And that hand can sometimes start a video chat."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>THE NEW POLIGNANO</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>One morning, Aldo organised a boat to take us on a tour of the grottoes beneath the town. He had to stay back, since there was nobody to watch his wife, who was sleeping erratically and kept him up at night. Instead, Giorgio and Sabrina joined us. Giorgio sat at the front of the boat next to my grandmother, pointing out the sites.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>A recent environmental law made it illegal for ships to tour the grottoes, but the boat captains were happy to dip in and out when the coast guard wasn't looking. Giorgio joined us as we jumped into the chilly water, and Sabrina stayed aboard, joking with my parents in a mix of Portuguese and Italian.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>When we weren't with Aldo and his family, my grandmother wanted to explore Polignano. It was still a charming hamlet with narrow limestone streets leading to scenic outposts overlooking the sea. But much had changed since her last visit. Polignano was no longer a beautiful, bombed-out secret hidden among the tangled olive trees of southern Italy. Red Bull had chosen Polignano as the site for its annual cliff-diving competition, which brought the town international attention. It was now overrun with impatient tourists trying to fit its beauty into manicured Instagram shots.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In fact, evidence of globalisation was everywhere. African migrants sold plastic hats made in China on street corners, and a marijuana smoke shop had opened next to the hotel where my grandmother had met Aldo. A sign in the town square read "Respect Our Town" in English.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>For Aldo, Polignano had become a minefield of bitter memories. Twenty years ago, a financial dispute led his family to sell the hotel his mother had slaved over. He never stepped foot in there again. A giant crane now covered the hotel's facade. It was undergoing renovations to accommodate the influx of tourists. But the restaurant in the cave was still operating, and my grandmother, who was allowed to watch guests dine there only from a distance at 15, wanted to see it up close.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>A BEAUTIFUL PLACE</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>On one of our lasts nights in Polignano, my grandmother descended the 60 steps into the cave for dinner. When we emerged onto the wooden deck, the view took my breath away. We were suspended some 30 feet above the sea, as waves thrashed against the rocks below, flooding the cave before gently retreating. The emerald water's reflection danced against the limestone dome of the cave, painting everything green. Inside, a saxophonist's mellow tunes rang off the dome's walls.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It was the most romantic place I had ever seen. And my grandmother was there alone, as Aldo had refused to come. He told her on the phone before she arrived that he couldn't go back there - the memories were too painful. She respected his decision and went without him.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>My grandmother looked up at the marble balcony, where so many years ago she had watched, entranced by the men and women dancing on the deck where she now stood. "Isn't it amazing?" she said, gazing out at the sea. "Only nature knows how many millions of years this has been here."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The next day, at another coffee shop, my grandmother told Aldo, "Now I understand why you didn't want to come to dinner yesterday." It was their last date before we were set to leave. "I was filled with immense nostalgia for the hotel. When I looked back at the grotto, I felt something." She placed her hand on her heart. "It's a singular place."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Aldo nodded sadly. "It's beautiful."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He pulled out a family photo from 1934, and my grandmother studied it. "I met every single one of them," she said. "We've had this shared life together. Isn't that crazy?" Aldo caught her up on the rest of the family members and what happened to each person in the photo, all of whom had died long ago.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"When do you leave?" he asked as he poured sugar into her coffee.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Tomorrow," she said. They both anxiously checked their watches. They still had 40 minutes before he had to head home. After chaperoning every moment they spent together, I got up and left my grandmother alone to enjoy the last moments of her last date.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p><strong>'I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW'</strong></p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>On our final morning, our bags packed, my grandmother stood at the gate of the hotel, clutching her iPhone and sighing periodically, looking for signs of Aldo. Finally, Aldo, Sabrina and Giorgio pulled up the driveway. The conversation turned to politics, corruption in Italy and in Brazil, and my parents invited Giorgio to visit them in Miami. As my grandmother poured sugar packets into her coffee, Aldo warned: "Not too much."</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Just two," she said. They both laughed.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>We thanked Aldo and his family for their hospitality and for making my grandmother so happy. "Our family will be an extension of yours," my dad said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>We walked them out, and I was surprised to see tears running down Sabrina's face. "Take care of him," my grandmother said, hugging her. Sabrina nodded, sobbing. Aldo took my grandmother's hand in his.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"Now, I will do the hardest thing: Turn around and walk away," he said. But my grandmother didn't allow herself to indulge in the finality of the moment. She gave him one last hug, and, as we walked away, she held up her phone and said: "I'll see you tomorrow."<span class="rangySelectionBoundary" id="selectionBoundary_1550100096224_058352383978948374" style="line-height: 0; display: none;">﻿</span></p>

        <p>BMW has, unsurprisingly, joined the madness that is the monster-powered SUV race with the release of the X3 M and X4 M powered by "most powerful straight-six petrol engine ever to see action in a BMW M car".</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>That is, by the way, a newly developed 3.0-litre inline six with high-revving unit with 353kW of power and 600Nm of torque.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Just in case you were worrying that those numbers seem to be slightly lower than the likes of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio (375kW/600Nm) and the mad Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 (375kW/700Nm), don't - BMW has got that covered off too.</p>

        <p>Alongside the "standard" X3 M and X4 M, the German company has also released Competition versions that get a power boost of 22kW that - and we are sure this is coincidental - takes the output to 375kW. Funny that.</p>

        <p>The engine is hooked up to an eight-speed automatic transmission and the latest M version of BMW's xDrive all-wheel-drive system, which made its debut in the M5 and has a rear-wheel bias. The X3 M and X4 M both sprint from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.2 seconds, while the Competition variants shave 0.1 of a second off that time.</p>

        <p>Of course, it's not just the engine in an M car that makes it special and like everything else to wear the hallowed badge, the X3 and X4 also get M-specific suspension, steering, brakes and 20-inch alloy wheels.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The Competition variants come on 21-inch M light-alloy wheels in polished black as standard, and also get an M Sport exhaust system.</p>

        <p>The new JCW GP will pack a version of the 2.0-litre 4-cylinder turbo engine found in the BMW X2 M35i and will be good for more than 220kW, easily making it the most powerful road-going Mini the German company has produced so far.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>It will be limited to just 3,000 units, which is 1,000 more than the previous JCW GP that came out in 2012 and the original version that was a limited kit available on the 2006 Cooper S.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Little else has been revealed about the new JCW GP other than a few teaser pictures that reveal it will wear a dramatic wing that is quite similar to the Concept GP from 2017.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>According to BMW New Zealand the X3 M and X4 M will be here before the end of the year along with a small handful of John Cooper Works GP, with local pricing announced closer to availability.</p>

        <p>But can it really be that a generation who became adults in the 21st Century are fonder of Percy Sledge than Justin Bieber and more likely to hum along to Blondie than Britney Spears?</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>For people my age, it's tempting to say they don't make them like they used to. But actually the truth is a little more complicated than that.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>No generation has a monopoly on talent, and much modern music is thrilling, amazing and wonderfully original.</p>

        <p>Whether you enjoy the glistening pop of Ariana Grande, the eccentric hip hop of Kanye West, the audacious rock of The 1975 or the continuing creativity of vintage stars such as Paul McCartney, there is plenty of new material for every possible taste. But that is part of the problem.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Hi-tech recording technology is now accessible to any computer-literate musical wannabe, with the result that we are practically drowning in a sea of new releases - so there's far more dross to wade through before you discover any gold.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>And apart from a few world-beating superstars like Adele and Ed Sheeran, there is very little agreement on what is worth our precious listening time.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>In a new era of stream and shuffle, listening habits are dictated by the delivery technology of smartphones and PCs. There are fewer shared spaces where all generations can hear music together. There's no Top of the Pops for families to fight over. Radio stations cater for ever more specific genres and demographics.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Meanwhile, millennials are glued to their screens, buds lodged in their ears, listening to algorithmically curated playlists built around their own ever-narrowing tastes. They don't even share their favourite music with each other, let alone annoy their parents with the latest craze. The internet has completely atomised popular music.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Young people, in particular, scroll through playlists the way they do social media sites, getting a short dopamine buzz and moving on to the next hit.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Their attachment to individual songs is tenuous, no longer nurtured by the kind of scarcity that made their parents lovingly obsess over vinyl, tapes or CDs.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Back in the days when you could only occasionally afford to add an album or single to your collection, you would listen to the same songs over and over again, until they penetrated deep into your very being.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Which is one reason why millennials may be more familiar with their parents' music collections than their own. They grew up listening to those songs, too, and they carry with them a reassuring sense of familiarity and community.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>They continue to be heard in the last remaining public musical spaces - on TV talent shows, cinema soundtracks and in shopping malls. Oldies may be the one thing we can all still agree upon.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But when millennials remove their ear buds long enough to raise families of their own, what songs are they going to be able to share?</p>

        <p>Warriors captain Roger Tuivasa-Sheck is taking some leadership tips from a former SAS veteran in a bid to become even better in 2019.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>The star fullback is adamant he wants to make "plenty of improvements" on his Dally M Award MVP season.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Leadership was one area he hoped to further develop, Tuivasa-Sheck said in <a href="https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/02/13/tuivasa-sheck-i-can-improve-on-my-dally-m-season/">a video interview on <em>NRL.com</em>.</a></p>

        <p>Tuivasa-Sheck was named Warriors captain in 2017 at the age of 23.

        <p>Hunter Bruce Smith, 22, said he has always been a "hard-out tomboy" but it was only later in life that he discovered what the LGBTQI+ community was.</p>

        <p>Initially, Smith found self-acceptance challenging and he became very badly depressed, to the point where he couldn't get out of bed.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>He moved home to be with family and to get their support.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>His mother was the first person he told he was transgender, at the age of 18.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>"It was a shock at first. She didn't know how to take it," he said.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>But his mother's "unconditional love" won, and after a few weeks the pair began deciding on a new name.</p>

        <p>Later, it was Hunter who suggested the pair sign up for auditions for the Spark video.</p>
    
    


                
            
             
                








    
        <p>Dee Smith said she did not know the focus would be on her until filming began, but the prospect did not worry her at all.</p>
